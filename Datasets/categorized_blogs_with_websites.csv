AAAAAAH! Phsamophobia haunts consoles this month,"Phasmophobia was one of the chief reasons a lot of gamers lost so much sleep during the pandemic. Now it’s finally headed to consoles after four years of frightening the hell out of us.
Kinetic Games’ ghost hunting game is heading to PlayStation 5, PS VR2 and Xbox Series X/S on October 29. Players on consoles and PCs through Steam can explore haunted places together in online sessions and discover the highest octave their voices can hit. Kinetic announced the game’s console release last year but unforeseen delays forced the studio to push back the date.
Since the game is launching on consoles just before Halloween, Kinetic Games is also holding a special in-game event. Teams will receive a special Halloween goal in which all teams playing on all platforms will work together to “permanently unlock the Blood Moon weather.” The achievement comes with a special badge and trophy and more reasons to scream your head off in future matches.
Phasmophobia is an addictive and horrifying four-player exploration game that came to life on PCs in 2020. As part of a team of ghost hunters, you’re dispatched to a haunted location to investigate and determine what type of horrifying soul is dispatching the living to the realm of the dead. Each team member uses various pieces of ghost hunting equipment and ethereal artifacts to determine the type of spirit doing the haunting and other required criteria about the entity, capture evidence of its presence and sometimes even make contact with the entity.
These ghosts and otherworldly creatures don’t just make doors slam shut and yell “Boo!” before scurrying off into the shadows. There are 20 different types of entities like banshees, demons wraiths and revenants that can call out your name in the darkness, drive down your sanity and even kill your ghost hunter if you&#39;re not careful.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/aaaaaah-phsamophobia-haunts-consoles-this-month-182546124.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/aaaaaah-phsamophobia-haunts-consoles-this-month-182546124.html?src=rss,"Thu, 17 Oct 2024 18:25:46 +0000",Sports,www.engadget.com
"Remedy's new game is FBC: Firebreak, a co-op shooter in the Control universe","After a long and winding road, Remedy Entertainment has unveiled its multiplayer follow-up to Control. FBC: Firebreak is for teams of three, and the trios will face down waves of enemies with an intriguing arsenal of weapons. For instance, the trailer shows a gatling gun of gloopy poison and a gun with a launching piston attached to the front for aerial attacks.
Since FBC: Firebreak is set in the same world as Control (and Alan Wake II), there will be more for players to explore about this surreal place. The trailer showed off gunfights in the Federal Bureau of Control and the Oldest House, familiar settings to those who have played Control and its DLC. But with the different approach to gameplay, FBC: Firebreak isn't intended to be a direct sequel to the psychological hit game. ""I guess you could say that it’s a spin-off, but in the most positive sense of the word,"" Game Director Mike Kayatta said. ""It’s not designed to be some kind of lesser, bite-sized Control. FBC: Firebreak is its own, fully formed thing.""
A co-op project from the studio was first teased all the way back in 2021. Firebreak has clearly gone through some refinements from the original concept Remedy announced with 505 Games. At the time, it was also working on a free-to-play co-op shooter with the conglomerate Tencent, but the codenamed Project Vanguard was scrapped in 2023. The duo attempted to reenvision the game as a premium title, but that also fell by the wayside.
FBC: Firebreak is currently scheduled for release in 2025 and it will be on Game Pass at launch. It is expected to launch on Xbox Series X|S, PC and PlayStation 5.&nbsp;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/remedys-new-game-is-fbc-firebreak-a-co-op-shooter-in-the-control-universe-180702570.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/remedys-new-game-is-fbc-firebreak-a-co-op-shooter-in-the-control-universe-180702570.html?src=rss,"Thu, 17 Oct 2024 18:07:02 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
The Annapurna-published cycling adventure Ghost Bike is now Wheel World,"Ghost Bike is dead; long live Wheel World. The scenic cycling adventure from the creators of Nidhogg was revealed in 2023 with a darker storyline. After design pivots to “make it more fun to play” (always a good idea!), the new naming convention matches its lighter tone. Initially slated for this year, the Annapurna-published game will now arrive in early 2025.
Wheel World is developer Messhof’s first 3D game and its first with a big team. The studio made its bones with Nidhogg, a side-scrolling sword-fighting game with old-school Atari-style graphics. With Wheel World, the team shifts gears (sorry) to a gorgeous cel-shaded art style. Unlike Messhof’s previous titles, this one will have a narrative — with characters and dialog boxes!
Messhof explained its rebranding in a press release. “[Ghost Bike] was a game about dying on a bike after being hit by a car and ending up in a cycling valhalla,” Messhof’s Mak Essen and Kristy Norindr wrote. “While it wasn’t directly based on real world ghost bikes (those white bikes memorializing cyclists killed by drivers), there was enough overlap to feel like the name was justified and the associations would be a positive one from both directions. But as things changed in the gameplay (to make it more fun to play), and thus the story (especially in tone) it fit less and less.” Wheel World, it is.
Messhof / Annapurna
You play as Kat, a young cyclist determined to “save Wheel World from total collapse.” Its gameplay combines racing, bike upgrades, recovering stolen parts and ultimately performing “The Great Shift ritual” to save the world.
The trailer also showcases a roaming mode for times when you want a relaxing gaming experience. An original soundtrack from the electronic label Italians Do It Better helps you chill out while cruising the beautifully cel-shaded countryside.
When it arrives in early 2025, Wheel World will be on Game Pass on day one. In addition to the Xbox Series X/S, it will also be available on PS5 and PC.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-annapurna-published-cycling-adventure-ghost-bike-is-now-wheel-world-173009766.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-annapurna-published-cycling-adventure-ghost-bike-is-now-wheel-world-173009766.html?src=rss,"Thu, 17 Oct 2024 17:30:09 +0000",Sports,www.engadget.com
Amazon will stream an election night special with Brian Williams,"Amazon Prime Video will host a live election night special hosted by Brian Williams. The veteran newscaster will deliver “election results and analysis” starting at 5PM ET on November 5. Interestingly, this is a free special and doesn’t require a Prime membership. It’ll also be live streaming throughout the world, and not just America.
Williams will be joined by a bevy of contributors to discuss election returns and the whole thing is being directed by industry veteran Glenn Weiss. He’s directed a whole bunch of live events, from the Oscars to the Emmys and beyond.
Amazon doesn’t have a news division, so it’ll be pulling results and commentary from third-party sources across all political affiliations, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Williams said in a statement that he “will follow the storyline on election night wherever it leads us.”
Albert Cheng, VP and head of Prime Video, says this is a “one-night-only” event, but it’s not without precedent. Prime Video made its first Black Friday NFL game available to stream live, even to people who don’t subscribe to the service.
As for Williams, he hosted the NBC Nightly News broadcast for more than a decade. The newscaster stepped down after exaggerations were found in some of his reporting, particularly with regard to stories from Iraq and related to Hurricane Katrina.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/amazon-will-stream-an-election-night-special-with-brian-williams-172040097.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/amazon-will-stream-an-election-night-special-with-brian-williams-172040097.html?src=rss,"Thu, 17 Oct 2024 17:20:40 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
The next Like A Dragon game recasts a series regular as an amnesiac pirate,"Update October 17, 1:17PM ET: Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has dropped a new gameplay trailer that shows some naval combat in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. It shows off some melee action too, with Majima summoning sharks and large monkeys to help him in battle. You&#39;ll be able to try this ridiculous action earlier than expected, as the release date has moved up a week from February 28 to February 21.
Our original story follows below:
Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio simply cannot stop pumping out Like A Dragon (aka Yakuza) games. The studio and publisher Sega have revealed that the next entry will hit PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Steam on February 21, just 13 months after Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth debuted. The latest spinoff has a typically kooky twist that’s not exactly kept secret by its title: Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.
A seven-minute announcement trailer shown at the studio&#39;s RGG Summit features Goro Majima, a regular of the series, explaining what&#39;s been going on with him recently. About six months earlier, Majima washed up on an island near Hawaii with no memory of how he got there, only to be helped out by a child with a pet tiger cub. It didn&#39;t take long until Majima ran afoul of some pirates and swiftly became a pirate captain himself.
Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii takes place a year after the events of Infinite Wealth and Ichiban Kasuga&#39;s exploits in that game. You&#39;ll assemble your crew, upgrade your ship, engage enemy vessels and discover hidden islands. Majima will have two fighting styles that you can switch between on the fly. Opt for the Mad Dog option to vex enemies with &quot;speed, agility and flair,&quot; and then switch to Sea Dog to dual wield short swords and &quot;pirate tools,&quot; according to a press release. However you slice it, Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii already looks way more fun than the 45 minutes I spent playing Skull and Bones.
While February 21 isn&#39;t too far away in the grand scheme of things, there are plenty of other Like A Dragon-related things to help keep you occupied in the meantime. Like A Dragon: Yakuza, a live-action TV show based on the series, will debut on Prime Video on October 24. The franchise is also debuting on Nintendo Switch the same day with a port of Yakuza Kiwami, a remake of the first game.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-next-like-a-dragon-game-recasts-a-series-regular-as-an-amnesiac-pirate-142935001.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-next-like-a-dragon-game-recasts-a-series-regular-as-an-amnesiac-pirate-142935001.html?src=rss,"Thu, 17 Oct 2024 17:17:45 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
Super Nintendo World Orlando opens next May,"The Super Nintendo World theme park in Orlando is nearly ready for visitors. Universal Orlando Resort just announced that the Mario-friendly attraction will open its doors on May 22, 2025. That gives you over six months to find the perfect Goomba costume to wear on opening day.
This is the third Nintendo theme park throughout the world, as the Orlando location joins pre-existing parks in Los Angeles and Japan. If the layout looks anything like the other two parks, you should expect a large interactive area to explore, special themed rides and, of course, all kinds of Nintendo-adjacent dining and shopping. The original Japanese park just got a nifty Donkey Kong Country area, but it remains to be seen if that’ll make the jump to the states.
This is part of a larger expansion of Universal Resort Orlando, called Universal Epic Universe. This includes five areas to explore. There’s the aforementioned Super Nintendo World, but this expansion will also host the pre-existing Harry Potter attraction.
The area will be home to a theme park based on the How to Train Your Dragon franchise and another based on the Dark Universe franchise. That last one is pretty odd to me, being as how the Dark Universe franchise peaked with a few middling horror films in the 2010s. Most of the planned films in this shared cinematic universe were scrapped after 2017’s The Mummy crashed and burned.&nbsp;
Finally, there’s Celestial Park. This looks to be a standard amusement park with a slight sci-fi bent. There are space-themed roller coasters and the like.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/super-nintendo-world-orlando-opens-next-may-164506895.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/super-nintendo-world-orlando-opens-next-may-164506895.html?src=rss,"Thu, 17 Oct 2024 16:45:06 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
Apple Pay now works with third-party iOS and desktop browsers,"Apple Pay debuted almost 10 years ago to the day, and Apple is marking the occasion by rolling out some features it revealed at WWDC. If you have iOS 18 or iPadOS 18 installed on your iPhone or iPad, you'll now be able to use the payment service on third-party browsers on those devices, as well as desktop computers. In the latter case, you'll be asked to scan a QR code with your iPhone or iPad to complete the payment. However, Apple says the feature is only available in select markets.
It'll be easier than ever to add supported cards to Apple Wallet on your iPhone. Thanks to the Tap to Provision feature, you can simply tap an eligible NFC-enabled card to the back of your phone, though you may have to enter the security code manually. Again, though, Tap to Provision isn't available everywhere.
Apple is now starting to support third-party buy now, pay later (BNPL) services in Apple Pay. This starts with the option to check out with Klarna in the US and UK. The company will add more installment payment options in the future, including Citi, Synchrony and eligible Apple Pay issuers via Fiserv in the US. Klarna will also be available as an option in Canada at a later date. Apple discontinued its own Pay Later option earlier this year
Meanwhile, US Apple Pay users can redeem rewards on eligible Discover credit cards at checkout. Support for rewards from other issuers and in more countries is on the way.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-pay-now-works-with-third-party-ios-and-desktop-browsers-163048055.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-pay-now-works-with-third-party-ios-and-desktop-browsers-163048055.html?src=rss,"Thu, 17 Oct 2024 16:30:48 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
2K Games wades into risky waters and announces a free-to-play hero shooter,"2K and developer 31st Union just unveiled Project: Ethos, a free-to-play 3rd-person hero shooter. It’s entering a crowded and fraught marketplace, but the publisher says this is an “exciting evolution” of the genre.
That evolution seems to take the form of some light roguelike mechanics. The playable characters evolve throughout each match, via semi-randomized upgrades unique to each hero. The publisher gives an example of evolving a sniper into a “close-range skirmisher” or a “support role into a powerful lone wolf.”
2K
The “abilities, stakes and challenges” change from match to match and players can eventually unlock powerful Augments to further enhance runs. It remains to be seen if these mechanics can set it apart from the pack, but you can find that out for yourself. There’s a community playtest going on right now.
Players can test out the game’s signature Trials mode, which is an “ongoing, persistent fight” or check out the Gauntlet. This is your standard head-to-head tournament mode, with teams and brackets.
This community playtest goes until October 20 in the US, Canada, Mexico and much of Europe. There is a fairly annoying hurdle to jump through to access the early build. You have to complete a Twitch Drop and stream 30 minutes of content from one of 2K’s partner creators. There’s no information yet regarding an actual release date for people who don’t want to sit through a 30-minute stream.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/2k-games-wades-into-risky-waters-and-announces-a-free-to-play-hero-shooter-160059725.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/2k-games-wades-into-risky-waters-and-announces-a-free-to-play-hero-shooter-160059725.html?src=rss,"Thu, 17 Oct 2024 16:00:59 +0000",Sports,www.engadget.com
Netflix's The Electric State trailer shows off cartoony robots and oversized VR headsets,"Netflix has released the first trailer for The Electric State, a post-apocalyptic road movie from Marvel (and Community) mainstays The Russo Brothers. The adaptation of Simon Stålenhag&#39;s 2018 graphic novel is set in a retro-futuristic version of the &#39;90s after a robot uprising. It tells the story of Michelle, an orphaned teenager (Millie Bobby Brown) who ventures across the west of the US to look for her younger brother with a smuggler (a mustachioed Chris Pratt) and a pair of robots.
The movie&#39;s look draws heavily from Stålenhag&#39;s gorgeous artwork, right down to the oversized VR helmets. The robots, in particular the one accompanying Michelle, have a cartoon-inspired aesthetic that wouldn&#39;t look out of place in Fallout. A large teddy bear robot can be seen as part of a parade of machines, while our heroes appear to face off against a massive one that looks a little like Sonic the Hedgehog.
Meanwhile, the whole &quot;slowed down iteration of a popular song in a movie trailer&quot; thing might have jumped the shark with the version of Oasis&#39; &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot; that plays over the top of this. It fits the &#39;90s setting, of course, but I couldn&#39;t help but laugh as soon as I recognized it.
The movie has a hell of a cast. Alongside Brown and Pratt, it stars Ke Huy Quan, Jason Alexander, Woody Harrelson, Anthony Mackie, Brian Cox, Jenny Slate, Giancarlo Esposito and Stanley Tucci. The Electric State hits Netflix on March 14.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/netflixs-the-electric-state-trailer-shows-off-cartoony-robots-and-oversized-vr-headsets-143628514.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/netflixs-the-electric-state-trailer-shows-off-cartoony-robots-and-oversized-vr-headsets-143628514.html?src=rss,"Thu, 17 Oct 2024 14:36:28 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
Google wants to put the consequences of its Epic antitrust ruling on pause during appeal,"Google has formally filed a motion [PDF] asking the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to put a pause on the order that forces the company to open the Play store to competitors. If you&#39;ll recall, Google lost an antitrust lawsuit filed by Epic Games after a federal jury found that the company held an illegal monopoly on app distribution and in-app billing services for Android devices. Earlier this month, US District Judge James Donato ordered Google to allow third-party app stores access to the Google Play app catalog and to make those stores downloadable from its storefront. Now, Google is asking the court for a stay on that order while it&#39;s appealing the Epic antitrust lawsuit decision, saying that it will expose 100 million Android users in the US to &quot;substantial new security risks.&quot;
The company called the order &quot;harmful and unwarranted&quot; and said that if it&#39;s allowed to stand, it will threaten Google&#39;s ability to &quot;provide a safe and trusted used experience.&quot; It argued that if it makes third-party app stores available for download from Google Play, people might think that the company is vouching for them, which could raise &quot;real risks for [its] users.&quot; Those app stores could have &quot;less rigorous protections,&quot; Google explained, that could expose users to harmful and malicious apps.&nbsp;
It also said that giving third-party stores access to the Play catalog could harm businesses that don&#39;t want their products available alongside inappropriate or malicious content. Giving third-party stores access to its entire library could give &quot;bad-intentioned&quot; stores a &quot;veneer of legitimacy.&quot; Moreover, it argued that allowing developers to link out from their apps &quot;creates significant risk of deceptive links,&quot; since bad actors could use the feature for phishing attacks to compromise users&#39; devices and steal their data.&nbsp;
One of court&#39;s main proposed changes is to allow developers to remove Google Play billing as an option, allowing them to offer their apps to Android users without having to pay the company a commission. However, Google said that by allowing developers to remove its billing system, it could &quot;force an option that may not have the safeguards and features that users expect.&quot;&nbsp;
In its filing, Google emphasized that the three weeks the court gave it to make these sweeping changes is too short for a &quot;Herculean task.&quot; It creates an &quot;unacceptable risk of safety&quot; that could lead to major issues affecting the functionality of users&#39; Android devices, it said. The company also questioned why the court sided with Epic in its antitrust lawsuit, whereas it sided with Apple in a similar case also filed by the video game company. &quot;It is pause-inducing that Apple, which requires all apps go through its proprietary App Store, is not a monopolist, but Google — which built choice into the Android operating system so device makers can preinstall and users can download competing app stores — was condemned for monopolization.&quot;
Epic Games provided Engadget with the following statement: &quot;The jury’s verdict and the court’s injunction were clear: Google’s anticompetitive Play Store practices are illegal. Google is merely fear mongering and falsely using security as a pretext to delay the changes mandated by the court. This is Google’s last ditch effort to protect their control over Android and continue extracting exorbitant fees. The court’s injunction must go into effect swiftly so developers and consumers can benefit from competition in the mobile ecosystem.&quot;
Update, October 17 2024, 10:17AM ET:This story has been updated to include a response from Epic Games to Google&#39;s motion.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-wants-to-put-the-consequences-of-its-epic-antitrust-ruling-on-pause-during-appeal-020354621.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-wants-to-put-the-consequences-of-its-epic-antitrust-ruling-on-pause-during-appeal-020354621.html?src=rss,"Thu, 17 Oct 2024 14:18:01 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
"A $105,000 robot arm nobody needs cooked me a delicious lunch","London’s W1 is somewhere to go if you’ve got too much money to spend on something. Within minutes of each other, you can visit the city’s priciest private doctor, buy a Steinway and a pair of designer glasses that cost more than my mortgage. Wigmore Street is also where the ultra rich go to buy a kitchen that Thorstein Veblen would weep at the sight of. It’s also the new home of Moley Robotics, a company selling luxury kitchens and the robot arm that’ll kinda/sorta do all of the cooking for you, too.
Moley is the brainchild of Dr. Mark Oleynik and is one part kitchen showroom and one part robot lab. It’s a spartan space with three demo kitchens, a wide dining table and some display units showing you the different types of artisan marble you can have for your countertop. The point of interest is the working X-AiR robot just behind the front window that acts as a lure for would-be consumers. It’s got its own cooktop, shelves, oils and utensils and, with the proper help, can even whip up a meal.
Moley

Oleynik explained he wanted to create something to help people eat better food with less reliance on preservatives. His dislike of reheated and processed food sent him looking for alternatives, which led him to finding a way to automate fresh cooking. If you’re coming back late from work, the obvious temptations are microwave meals or delivery food. He believes people would much rather healthy recipes where you just prep the raw ingredients and let the robot do the rest. The focus on health extends to the database of potential meals, many of which have been created by the SHA Wellness Clinic.
Moley has its own in-house chef, James Taylor, who adapts each recipe so it can be made by a one-armed robot. The company says it hopes to add two or three new recipes each month, and that if you have a family dish you’d love to see automated, you can send it in. Oleynik said the movements are mapped onto the robot after watching a human chef prepare the same meal. And that, once it had learned what to do, the robot would be far less error-prone than its human counterpart.
The initial demonstration of Moley’s vision (above)  used a two-armed chef that ran on overhead tracks that earned the company so many plaudits initially. Unfortunately, Oleynik admitted the cost for such a robot would have likely reached north of £250,000 (Around $330,000). Which is probably too rich even for the sort of people who frequent Wigmore Street for their kitchen appliances. To reduce the price, the company stripped down the project from a mobile, two-armed version to a single arm. The robot that Moley is actually selling is bought off-the-shelf from Universal Robots, an industrial robotics company.
The robot

The one-armed version that’s currently up for pre-order is known as the X-AiR, which is what sits in the front of Moley’s showroom. If you want one for yourself, you’ll need to buy a new countertop, two custom shelving units, a cooktop, control tablet and the robot itself. The prices are in the “if you have to ask, you can’t afford it” range but the price to get in the door is £80,000 (around $105,000). So far, Moley hasn’t installed a single robot, but expects the process to begin in the next three to six months. But there are people who have already laid down cash to get one of these in their homes, and the kitchen that goes around it.
X-AiR has no built-in vision or sensing technology enabling it to perceive or engage with its environment. The system does come with a camera, embedded in one of the shelves, that I understand is more for technical support than to aid cooking. Instead, the robot arm moves around its space from memory, knowing where all of the ingredients, oils and tools should be. The saucepans are held in place over the jobs on the cooktop to keep the environment as controlled as possible.
I was present to witness Moley’s now standard demonstration using an SHA Clinic recipe for Asian Tofu Saute. Staff members had pre-prepared the ingredients and placed them in the pots necessary for the robot to grab. In order to start the process, the user needs to tell the system which ingredients are in which sections. There’s even a little diagram of the shelf layout, so you can tap “Bean Sprouts” and tap that the pot with them is seated in position A1, for instance. Once you’ve done that, you can set the machine going and theoretically leave it be until it’s time to eat.
The system is set up to call out every instruction from the recipe so it’s easy to follow along with it. In the video, you should be able to see why it’s an interesting thing to watch as the arm starts its ballet to start cooking your food. It almost theatrically turns on the cooktop before pouring a liberal quantity of oil into the pan to begin warming. After that, it begins adding the ingredients as and when commanded to, and stirring the mixture in between. The stirring is more of a back and forth pushing of the mix, which is obviously less thorough than a human would be. After each stir, the robot scrapes its spatula on the side of the pan before returning it to its hook.
There are similar touches when the robot adds the next ingredient from its dedicated bin, double tapping the pot on the side to ensure everything falls out. I noticed, however, that there were a few ingredients still attached to the spatula and the pots when they were returned to the shelf. This is the big issue with a robot that lacks any sort of vision to perceive its local environment. During my demonstration, a few strips of leek clung to the spatula and fell off, onto the cooktop itself, while in motion. It was quickly wiped away, but I couldn’t help but wonder what would have happened if it’d landed a millimeter closer to the burner and pan and started burning.
What it can’t do

I’m much happier tending to a pan and actually cooking than I am peeling carrots and trying to dice onions. The obvious question, then, is why Moley sought to automate the ostensibly fun part of cooking rather than the bit people dislike? Oleynik said it might be possible in a far-flung future but there are just too many variables to make a carrot-peeling robot work. Not to mention, he added, the safety risks inherent in giving a robot a bladed instrument to wield.
Moley’s first-generation robots are also limited by the volume of food they can cook in a single session. Depending on the meal, they can make between eight and ten portions, enough for a dinner party but nothing more extravagant. Not to mention the robots can’t make much of any adjustment if you don’t have exactly the right ingredients ready for use. You can remove any you don’t have, naturally, but there’s no ability to improvise beyond that, or to variate its program to take into account seasonal differences in ingredient quality.
The food

When I was told the robot was making me tofu, I had to work hard to keep myself standing upright. If they could have seen my soul, they’d have watched my shoulders droop so hard they fell through the floor, through the basement, and into the subway line below. Friends, I cannot stand tofu and grimace my way through it whenever my vegan chums insist we go to a meat-free restaurant. Even when they insist I’m eating “really good” tofu, it just tastes like stringy matter, devoid of any inherent flavor as I try to mash it in my mouth. So bear that in mind when I say that the tofu the robot cooked me was actually delicious. It had a nice texture and tasted pretty delicious, meshing beautifully with the vegetables.
The future
Oleynik believes his robots will find a variety of niches to fill, first with money-rich, time-poor folks in London and beyond. The internet tells me that a private chef would set you back around £300 a day, so you’d burn through that £80,000 in less than a year. Naturally, it’s likely anyone who can drop £80,000 on a cooking robot can probably afford to buy their ingredients pre-prepared, so they could just dump them in the bins and set things going.
After that, Oleynik believes the technology could be used to prepare fresh meals for business and first-class airline passengers. Or in small kitchens where one employee supervises a production line of robots all making fresh dishes. His vision stretches to any situation where there may be a desire for fresh-cooked food, but the economics of a trained chef won’t allow it.
He cited the example of a hotel with 24/7 room service, where people are paid to wait around on the off-chance someone wants food. Or service stations in remote areas where there’s potential demand for meals but no need to hire a professional chef. Similarly, Oleynik cited care homes where there’s a similar conflict between a desire to produce good food but limited budgets.
Of course, it’s not clear, given there would need to be a human preparing the raw ingredients and dishing up, how much labor is being saved. And anyone who is involved with food would likely need to be trained and paid accordingly, which may eliminate any potential savings. But Oleynik is certain that a business can expect to see a return on its investment within its first year of service.
As for the price, Oleynik believes the technology will refine to the point that the cost will fall quite far. He gestured to one of the demo kitchens in the showroom, which had a Miele-branded oven and fridge, saying each model cost £5,000 (around $6,500) each. He hopes he’ll be able to sell a cooking robot for £10,000 to the sort of people who don’t blink when spending £5,000 on an oven and another £5,000 on a fridge. But, if nothing else, it’s entirely in keeping with everything else you can buy on Wigmore Street.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/a-105000-robot-arm-nobody-needs-cooked-me-a-delicious-lunch-140050065.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/a-105000-robot-arm-nobody-needs-cooked-me-a-delicious-lunch-140050065.html?src=rss,"Thu, 17 Oct 2024 14:00:50 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
LG's C3 OLED TVs are more than $600 off before Black Friday,"Update 10/17/24 11:05am ET: Amazon has raised the price of the 55-inch model by $100, which brings the final price down to $1,297. While not quite as low as it was just a few hours ago, that's still about $500 off the original price and a good deal. 
 
I don't know about you but I will be spending most of the upcoming cold months sitting on my couch and watching television (with some books thrown in). The only thing I'm missing is a really good television set and, while I'll be opting for a more budget-friendly pick, I'm tempted by the sale on LG's C3 Series OLED TV. Right now, the 55-inch model is down to $1,197 from $1,800 — a 34 percent discount. The all-time low price isn't the only version on sale, with the 42-inch option dropping to $997 from $1,197. 
LG released the C3 series last year as a mid-range OLED option. It offers an a9 AI Processor Gen6, HDR tone mapping, AI upscaling and object-based picture sharpening. The TVs also come with Brightness Booster, which — though not to the level of some of its competitors — makes it easier to watch even in a relatively sunny room.&nbsp; 
  
If you want the newest model then check out LG's C4 OLED series. The 2024 release is also on sale, with the 55-inch version down to $1,297 from $2,000 — the same 35 percent discount we recently saw on Prime Day. The C4 TVs offer nearly 1,000 nits of brightness and a maximum refresh rate of 144Hz. This model will also wirelessly connect with LG soundbars, foregoing the need for messy cables.&nbsp;

Apple Music helps artists turn concert set lists into playlists,"There's a certain level of fandom you hit when you research a band's tour set list before they come to your city. And some of us like to relive great concerts with some quick research on setlist.fm. The next logical step, once we're armed with this information, is to create a playlist on our preferred streaming service for quick access. Thanks to third-party options like Setify, the process is easy for Apple Music and Spotify users, but you still have to take the time to do it.&nbsp;
Apple Music has now given artists the ability to turn set lists into playlists thanks to info from tour info site Bandsintown. Once an artist has connected the two services, they can select the type of show in Apple Music for Artists (concert, tour or residency) and link it to upcoming dates on Bandsintown. From there, artists can set a publish date and use search to build out the playlist. These collections of songs can include original tunes the artist covers or collaborations with other acts. Apple Music allows unlimited set list playlists for past or future shows, but the service recommends that artists select a track listing that most accurately reflects the whole tour if they're making one for an entire run of dates.&nbsp;
Set lists playlists aren't entirely new on Apple Music. The service has been curating playlists for popular tours for a while now, like Zach Bryan's 2024 Quittin' Time Tour. What's more, Apple Music is touting this new tool as a promotional feature for artists, so there are a number of ways to share the playlists once they're live. However, it will also be a great item for fans who either want more info on the songs they can expect to hear, can't make it to a stop on a tour or want to relive the experience of seeing the band in person.&nbsp;
Of course, if one of your favorites doesn't hop on this bandwagon, you still have options for set list playlists. With Setify, you can link either Apple Music or Spotify and pull in data from setlist.fm in order to make your collections. It's not perfect, but it works well most of the time, and you can always adjust things in the streaming service apps if you need to further curate a playlist. I recently missed one of my all-time favorites at Furnace Fest, but thanks to this combo, I can at least get a small piece of Blindside playing through About a Burning Fire.

The USB-C Apple Pencil drops to a new all-time low of $65,"While iPads are cheaper and much handier to carry around than MacBooks, you often need an extra iPad accessory or two to make them as useful. While an attachable keyboard can be great for anyone with a writing job (hello!) an Apple pencil is critical for everything from studying to designing. Thankfully, it's cheaper than ever to get the budget option with the USB-C Apple Pencil on sale for $65, down from $79. The 18 percent discount brings the accessory to $5 less than its Prime Day price.&nbsp; 
Apple released its USB-C Pencil in late 2023 as a cheaper option than its counterparts, the second generation Apple Pencil and Apple Pencil Pro. This Pencil is compatible with all iPads with a USB-C port and offers the hover feature when using an M2 iPad Air or the iPad Pro. It also has some great perks like low latency, tilt sensitivity and pixel-perfect accuracy. However, it doesn't have pressure sensitivity like its fellow Apple Pencils.&nbsp;

A new Chrome extension can reliably detect AI-generated voices,"Just in time for the 2024 US elections, the call screening and fraud detection company Hiya has launched a free Chrome extension to spot deepfake voices. The aptly named Hiya Deepfake Voice Detector “listens” to voices played in video or audio streams and assigns an authenticity score, telling you whether it’s likely real or fake.
Hiya tells Engadget that third-party testers have validated the extension as over 99 percent accurate. The company says that even covers AI-generated voices the detection model hasn’t trained on, and the company claims it can spot voices created by new synthesis models as soon as they’re launched.
We played around with the extension ahead of launch, and it seems to work well. I pulled up a YouTube video about the blues pioneer Howlin’ Wolf that I suspected used AI narration, and it assigned it a 1/100 authenticity score, declaring it likely a deepfake. Suspicions confirmed.
Hiya
Hiya threw a well-earned jab at social media companies for making such a tool necessary. “It’s clear social media sites have a huge responsibility to alert users when the content they are consuming has a high chance of being an AI deepfake,” Hiya President Kush Parikh wrote in a press release. “The onus is currently on the individual to be vigilant to the risks and use tools like our Deepfake Voice Detector to check if they are concerned content is being altered. That’s a big ask, so we’re pleased to be able to support them with a solution that helps put some of the power back in their hands.”
The extension only needs to listen to a few seconds of a voice to spit out a result. It works on a credit system to prevent Hiya’s servers from getting slammed by excessive requests. You’ll get 20 credits daily, which may or may not cover the flood of manipulative AI content you’ll come across on social media in the coming weeks.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/a-new-chrome-extension-can-reliably-detect-ai-generated-voices-130059842.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/ai/a-new-chrome-extension-can-reliably-detect-ai-generated-voices-130059842.html?src=rss,"Thu, 17 Oct 2024 13:00:59 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
Microsoft recruits accessibility app to make its AI more useful to blind and low-vision users,"Be My Eyes, the accessibility app for mobile devices that puts blind and low-vision people on a live video call with a sighted guide, will help Microsoft train its AI. Be My Eyes will provide anonymized video data to improve scene understanding in Microsoft’s accessibility-focused AI models.
The data sets Be My Eyes gives Microsoft will include “unique objects, lighting and framing that realistically represents the lived experience of the blind and low vision community.” The goal is to make Microsoft’s AI more inclusive for people with vision disabilities.
The companies say all personal info has been scrubbed from the metadata. The provided data won’t be used for advertising or any purpose other than training Microsoft’s AI models.
Although this is Be My Eyes’ first such data partnership, it’s worked with Microsoft before by incorporating its Be My AI tool into Microsoft’s Disability Answer Desk. As its name suggests, Be My AI is the company’s GPT-4-powered spin on an assistance product. In that case, it helps people with vision disabilities navigate Office, Windows and Xbox.
Be My Eyes also struck a deal with Hilton earlier this month. In that case, dedicated hotel staff help blind and low-vision lodgers do things like adjust their thermostats, make coffee and raise or lower their blinds. A previous 2023 partnership between the two companies helped train the Be My AI model.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-recruits-accessibility-app-to-make-its-ai-more-useful-to-blind-and-low-vision-users-130006439.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-recruits-accessibility-app-to-make-its-ai-more-useful-to-blind-and-low-vision-users-130006439.html?src=rss,"Thu, 17 Oct 2024 13:00:06 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
DJI confirms that US customs is holding up its latest consumer drone,"Many of DJI&#39;s drones including its latest consumer products are being held up at the US border, the manufacturer said in a blog post today. It appears to be a customs matter and not related to proposed US legislation to ban DJI products (the Countering CCP Drones Act) currently in US Congress. However, the holdup means that sales of DJI&#39;s latest Air 3S drone will be delayed, the company told The Verge.&nbsp;
&quot;The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has cited the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), as the reason for the current holdups,&quot; the DJI ViewPoints team wrote. &quot;This assertion made against DJI, however, is entirely unfounded and categorically false.&quot;
Calling the situation a &quot;misunderstanding,&quot; DJI said it&#39;s sending documentation proving it complies with the UFLPA. It added that it has no manufacturing facilities in and doesn&#39;t source materials from Xinjiang, the region that&#39;s a red flag for the US in terms of Uyghur forced labor violations. It also noted that it&#39;s not a listed entity under UFLPA and that its supply &quot;undergoes rigorous due diligence by respected US retailers.&quot; US Customs and Border Protection has yet to comment on the matter.
While the US House of Representatives did pass the a bill to block DJI&#39;s drones, the Senate removed that clause from the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act. It was later re-introduced as an amendment, though, and could still make it into the final bill. If so, imports of new DJI drones could be blocked, but a ban wouldn&#39;t likely prohibit current owners from using them. DJI has a massive share of the worldwide drone market upwards of 70 percent as of 2021, according to Statista. including as much as 90 percent by public safety officials.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-confirms-that-us-customs-is-holding-up-its-latest-consumer-drone-123007447.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-confirms-that-us-customs-is-holding-up-its-latest-consumer-drone-123007447.html?src=rss,"Thu, 17 Oct 2024 12:30:07 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
Uber is reportedly exploring an Expedia takeover,"Uber is reportedly exploring the idea of purchasing Expedia, one of the largest travel booking companies in the world, according to the Financial Times. Expedia, which is valued at $20 billion and which reported its highest-ever annual revenue in 2023, will be the company&#39;s biggest acquisition, if the deal does indeed push through. The Times says it&#39;s very early days, however, and Uber hasn&#39;t even made a formal offer for the travel company yet. It&#39;s still in the process of studying the implications of acquiring Expedia and has, over the past months, worked with advisers to figure out whether the deal is feasible and how it would be structured.&nbsp;
The company&#39;s CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, may have to sit out deal discussions, seeing as he used to be CEO of Expedia before he was hired by the ride-hailing service in 2017. He&#39;s still in its Board of Directors, as well. It doesn&#39;t sound like Khosrowshahi was the one who suggested the potential purchase, though — in its report, the Times said the idea was &quot;broached by a third party.&quot;
Uber has had plans to become a wider travel booking platform for a while now. Khosrowshahi said he wanted Uber to be the &quot;Amazon of transportation&quot; from the time he joined the company. Since then, the ride-hailing service has added train, bus and flight bookings in some markets, and it has also made several large acquisitions. It purchased online food delivery service Postmates for $2.65 billion and alcohol delivery service Drizly for $1.1 billion before shutting it down three years later. The company also teamed up with Waymo and Cruise to offer autonomous rides in certain markets. As the Times notes, Uber became profitable for the first time in 2023 due to a renewed demand for rides and food delivery and could be a in a good position to acquire a company as big as Expedia.&nbsp;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/uber-is-reportedly-exploring-an-expedia-takeover-120038754.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/uber-is-reportedly-exploring-an-expedia-takeover-120038754.html?src=rss,"Thu, 17 Oct 2024 12:00:38 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
How to to stream with a VPN on your Apple TV,"The Apple TV is one of the best streaming devices you can get right now to add Netflix, Disney+, Max and other streaming apps to your boring old TV. It costs more than the competition, but it offers a more polished experience (the screensavers are worth the price of admission) as well as more privacy protections. But you may not know that, with a VPN, you can use your Apple TV to access even more content. By downloading one of several VPN apps directly to the Apple TV, you can spoof your IP address, tricking your system into thinking you’re in a different country. And because most streaming services license different shows in different territories, flipping the VPN to an international location lets you access a wider array of content. Here’s how to use a VPN on your Apple TV and why you might want to install one.
How to use a VPN on Apple TV
As of the September 2023 release of the tvOS 17 software update, the Apple TV platform supports third-party VPN apps. Setting them up is easy; just follow these steps (these may vary slightly between VPNs):
In the Apple TV App Store, search for the VPN you want to download or search for the keyword “VPN” to see your options.
Download and install your chosen VPN.
Sign up or log in.
We have a comprehensive guide on how to stream video to your TV using a VPN, which covers Apple TV installation and provides alternative methods for connecting a VPN to your Apple TV.
Why you should use a VPN on Apple TV
As previously mentioned, using a VPN on your Apple TV allows you to change your IP address to make it seem like you’re browsing from a different country. This happens as the VPN encrypts your connection and tunnels it through the VPN’s digital or physical servers located in other countries. So if you’re in the US and tunnel to a UK VPN server, you’ll be able to access the UK Netflix content library and watch shows on UK-only services like BBC iPlayer.
VPNs can also be essential security tools, although their features apply best when you’re using them on a smartphone or PC where you do most of your internet browsing. If you purchase a VPN subscription with your Apple TV in mind, we recommend using it on your smartphone and laptop, too. A VPN can help keep you anonymous online and protect your data from malicious parties or advertising networks. If you care about digital privacy and anonymity, it’s good practice to use a VPN across all devices with internet connectivity.
Choosing the right VPN
Apple TVs only work with a limited number of VPNs. Although that seems like a hindrance, Apple vets the VPNs it allows on its App Store, and you can feel reassured knowing they’re trustworthy options. Every one of the top picks on our best VPNs list is on the Apple TV app store.
We encourage you to do your own research when choosing a service. Although each VPN has the same basic functionalities, their price and extra features vary. Before deciding which one is right for your needs and the devices you have, take some time to look at what each one offers and see what other users have to say.
VPN options for other streaming platforms
Don&#39;t have an Apple TV? Good news: Robust VPN options (or alternatives) exist for the other major streaming platforms, too.

The Morning After: Amazon finally made a Kindle with a color display,"In a barrage of Kindle hardware, Amazon might have something for anyone looking to upgrade from a basic Kindle. The biggest reveal might be the Kindle Colorsoft, its first reader with a color display. Amazon tried to ensure the reader has a good color and black-and-white experience, with high contrast, high resolution and high clarity whether you&#39;re looking at a color image or a black-and-white page. Amazon uses nitride LEDs, which work with the company’s algorithm to enhance color and brightness without washing out images.
Judging by the press images (and the demos we went to), these seem primed for graphic novels and comics. If you’re looking for something to digitally house your comics and manga, the Kindle Colorsoft will cost you $280 and start shipping on October 30.

Instagram is adding new features to prevent teen sextortion scams,"Meta is continuing its flurry of teen safety features for Instagram as the company faces mounting questions about its handling of younger users’ privacy and safety in its apps. The latest batch of updates are meant to tighten its protections against sextortion.
With the changes, Meta says it will make it harder for “potentially scammy” accounts to target teens on Instagram. The company will start to send follow requests from such accounts to users’ spam folders or block them entirely. The app will also start testing an alert that notifies teens when they receive a message from such an account, warning them that the message appears to be coming from a different country.
Additionally, when the company detects that a potential scammer is already following a teen, it will prevent them from being able to view teens’ follower lists and accounts that have tagged them in photos. The company isn’t saying exactly how it’s determining which accounts are deemed “potentially scammy,” but a spokesperson said they’re using signals such as the age of the account and whether it has mutual followers with the teen it’s attempting to interact with.
Meta
Meta is also making changes to prevent the spread of intimate images. Instagram will no longer allow users to screenshot or screen record images shared over DMs via the app’s ephemeral messaging feature and will no longer allow these images to be opened from the web version of Instagram. The app will also expanding the nudity protection feature it began testing earlier this year to all teens on the app. The tool automatically blurs images when nudity is detected in an image shared over DMs, and provides warnings and resources when such an image is detected.
The changes are meant to address the realities of how sextortion scams, in which scammers coerce teens into sending intimate images that are then used to threaten and blackmail them, are often carried out over Instagram. A report from Thorn and the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC) earlier this year found that Instagram, along with Snapchat, were the “most common” platforms used by scammers “as initial contact points.”
These scams are carried out by individuals and groups that sometimes organize on Meta’s own platforms. Alongside the updates, Meta said that it removed 800 groups on Facebook and 820 accounts, linked to a group known as the Yahoo Boys, that “were attempting to organize, recruit and train new sextortion scammers.”
Meta’s updates come as it faces increasing pressure to strengthen safety features for its youngest users. The company is currently facing a lawsuit from more than 30 states over the issue. (Earlier this week, a federal judge rejected Meta’s attempt to have the lawsuit dismissed.) New Mexico is also suing the company and has alleged that Meta didn’t do enough to stop adults from sexually harassing teens on its apps, particularly Instagram.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-is-adding-new-features-to-prevent-teen-sextortion-scams-111047916.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-is-adding-new-features-to-prevent-teen-sextortion-scams-111047916.html?src=rss,"Thu, 17 Oct 2024 11:00:47 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com

Apple will launch a Business Caller ID service next year,"Apple introduced some new tools to its Apple Business Connect program that could be useful for the everyday consumer. The most notable update is the introduction of Business Caller ID. When this feature rolls out next year, companies of any size can register to have their name, logo and department appear when they contact customers. In practice, that can help people distinguish between a phone call from a legitimate business and spam.
Apple Business Connect allows companies to have more control over how they appear within different apps across the Apple ecosystem. In 2023, Apple offered businesses customization for their listings in Maps, Messages, Siri and Wallet. Today's updates make Business Connect branding tools available to any company, including those without a brick-and-mortar location. In addition to the eventual rollout of Business Caller ID, the program is also adding brand info within the Mail and Phone apps. Participating companies can also add their logo to the Tap to Pay feature for contactless payments.

Two Sudanese brothers accused of launching a dangerous series of DDoS attacks,"Newly unsealed grand jury documents revealed that two Sudanese nationals allegedly attempted to launch thousands of distributed denial of services (DDoS) attacks on systems across the world. The documents allege that these hacks aimed to cause serious financial and technical harm to government entities and companies and even physical harm in some cases.
The US Department of Justice (DoJ) unsealed charges against Ahmed Salah Yousif Omer and Alaa Salah Yusuuf Omer that resulted in federal grand jury indictments. The two are allegedly connected to more than 35,000 DDoS attacks against hundreds of organizations, websites and networks as part of a “hacktivism” scheme as part of the cybercrime group Anonymous Sudan and a for-profit cyberattack service.
Even though Anonymous Sudan claimed to be an activist group, the pair also held some companies and entity’s systems for ransom for rates as high as $1,700 per month.
Both face indictments for their role in the coordinated cyberattacks including one count each of conspiracy to damage protected computers. Ahmed also faces three additional counts of damaging protected computers and could receive a statutory maximum sentence of life in federal prison, according to court records filed last June in the US Central District Court of California.
The brothers’ activities date back to early 2023. The two used a distributed cloud attack tool (DCAT) referred to as “Skynet Botnet” in order to “conduct destructive DDoS attacks and publicly claim credit for them,” according to a DoJ statement. Ahmed posted a message on Anonymous Sudan’s Telegram channel, “The United States must be prepared, it will be a very big attack, like what we did in Israel, we will do in the United States ‘soon.’”
One of the indictments listed 145 “overt acts” on organizations and entities in the US, the European Union, Israel, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The Skynet Botnet attacks attempted to disrupt services and networks in airports, software networks and companies including Cloudflare, X, Paypal and Microsoft that caused outages for Outlook and OneDrive in June of last year. The attacks also targeted state and federal government agencies and websites including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Pentagon and the DoJ and even hospitals including one major attack on Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles causing a slowdown of health care services as patients were diverted to other hospitals. The hospital attack led to the hacking charges against Ahmed that carry potential life sentences.
“3 hours+ and still holding,” Ahmed posted on Telegram in February, “they&#39;re trying desperately to fix it but to no avail Bomb our hospitals in Gaza, we shut down yours too, eye for eye...”
FBI special agents gathered evidence of the pair’s illegal activities including logs showing that they sold access to Skynet Botnet to more than 100 customers to carry out attacks against various victims who worked with investigators including Cloudflare, Crowdstrike, Digital Ocean, Google, PayPal and others.
Several Amazon Web Services (AWS) clients were among Anonymous Sudan’s victims as part of the hacking-for-hire scheme, according to court records and an AWS statement. AWS security teams worked with FBI cybercrime investigators to track the attacks back to “an array of cloud-based servers,&quot; many of which were based in the US. The discovery helped the FBI determine that the Skynet Botnet attacks were coming from a DCAT instead of a botnet that forwarded the DDoS to its victims through cloud-based servers and open proxy resolvers.
Perhaps the group’s most brazen and dangerous attack took place in April of 2023 that targeted Israel’s rocket alert system called Red Alert. The mobile app provides real time updates for missile attacks and security threats. The DDoS attacks attempted to infiltrate some of Red Alert’s Internet domains. Ahmed claimed responsibility for the Red Alert attacks on Telegram along with similar DDoS strikes on Israeli utilities and the Jerusalem Post news website.
“This group’s attacks were callous and brazen — the defendants went so far as to attack hospitals providing emergency and urgent care to patients,” US Attorney Martin Estrada said in a released statement. “My office is committed to safeguarding our nation’s infrastructure and the people who use it, and we will hold cyber criminals accountable for the grave harm they cause.”
Update, October 16, 7:25PM ET: This article was modified after publish to make clear that AWS clients, rather than AWS, were the target of Anonymous Sudan.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/two-sudanese-brothers-accused-of-launching-a-dangerous-series-of-ddos-attacks-215638291.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/two-sudanese-brothers-accused-of-launching-a-dangerous-series-of-ddos-attacks-215638291.html?src=rss,"Wed, 16 Oct 2024 21:56:38 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
The Kindle Oasis will be discontinued as Amazon says goodbye to page-turn buttons,"Amazon is sunsetting the Kindle Oasis. This decision means there will be no models of the ereader remaining with physical buttons for turning pages. ""Once current inventory of Kindle Oasis sells out online and in stores, we will not restock the device,"" Amazon rep Devon Corvasce told The Verge. ""Today, all of our devices are touch-forward which is what our customers are comfortable with.""
The Oasis model debuted in 2016. Its lightweight, asymmetrical design for one-handed use was a standout, but the high price tag may have kept most people from really considering the product. If you are not most comfortable with a touch interface for your reading, there are still options for flipping pages via buttons on the market. The Kobo Libra Color is one of our favorites.
Even with the Oasis becoming nothing but a mirage, the Kindle family isn't getting any smaller. Amazon announced several upgrades to the device line this week, including its first ever color ereader in the Kindle Colorsoft. We also got hands-on time with the latest Kindle Scribe and the Kindle Paperwhite has also received a refresh.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/the-kindle-oasis-will-be-discontinued-as-amazon-says-goodbye-to-page-turn-buttons-213538052.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/the-kindle-oasis-will-be-discontinued-as-amazon-says-goodbye-to-page-turn-buttons-213538052.html?src=rss,"Wed, 16 Oct 2024 21:35:39 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
SpaceX is suing the California Coastal Commission for not letting it launch more rockets,"Last week, the California Coastal Commission rejected a plan for SpaceX to launch up to 50 rockets this year at the Vandenberg Space Force Base in Santa Barbara County. The company responded yesterday with a lawsuit, alleging that the state agency's denial was overreaching its authority and discriminating against its CEO.
The Commission's goal is to protect California's coasts and beaches, as well as the animals living in them. The agency has control over private companies' requests to use the state coastline, but it can't deny activities by federal departments. The denied launch request was actually made by the US Space Force on behalf of SpaceX, asking that the company be allowed to launch 50 of its Falcon 9 rockets, up from 36.
While the commissioners did raise concerns about SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's political screed and the spotty safety records at his companies during their review of the launch request, the assessment focused on the relationship between SpaceX and Space Force. The Space Force case is that ""because it is a customer of — and reliant on — SpaceX’s launches and satellite network, SpaceX launches are a federal agency activity,"" the Commission review stated. ""However, this does not align with how federal agency activities are defined in the Coastal Zone Management Act’s regulations or the manner in the Commission has historically implemented those regulations."" The California Coastal Commission claimed that at least 80 percent of the SpaceX rockets contain payloads for Musk's Starlink company rather than payloads for government clients.
The SpaceX suit filed with the Central District of California court is seeking an order to designate the launches as federal activity, which would cut the Commission's oversight out of its future launch plans.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacex-is-suing-the-california-coastal-commission-for-not-letting-it-launch-more-rockets-204610537.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacex-is-suing-the-california-coastal-commission-for-not-letting-it-launch-more-rockets-204610537.html?src=rss,"Wed, 16 Oct 2024 20:46:10 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
Sony's ULT Wear wireless headphones are down to a record-low price,"Sony makes some of the best headphones around at the higher end but it has a broad range of options available at other price points as well. Our pick for the best wireless headphones is the company's WH-1000XM5, which will typically run you $400. If you can't swing that, the mid-range ULT Wear headphones are a decent option, especially since they're on sale. They've dropped to $148, which is $52 off the regular price of $200. That marks an all-time low price for this model. 
These are the first headphones to use ULT Power Sound, a new iteration of Sony's Extra Bass lineup. So it's safe to say you can expect plenty of oomph on the low end with the ULT Wear. 
  
In fact, we believe that Sony has done a better job of implementing its bass boost tech here than in previous models. We gave the ULT Wear headphones a score of 78 in our review, highlighting the comfortable design, generally strong audio quality and improvements to active noise cancellation. 
However, the ULT boost feature can prove to be a bit much. We felt that the ULT 2 setting, which delivers deeper bass and more powerful all-round audio, didn't sound all that good and was somewhat overbearing on the low end. The sound can get muddy in some other instances, such as when playing metal and synth-heavy electronica. 
As you might expect, the ULT Wear doesn't have all of the same features as Sony's higher-end headphones. But it does have a number of nifty functions. Putting an open hand over the right ear cup activates Quick Attention mode, which lowers the volume. Sony's Adaptive Sound Control tool can automatically adjust settings based on your activity or location. Other features include 360 Reality Audio with head tracking and 30 hours of battery life.

Google Flights now has a ‘Cheapest’ tab,"Airline travel can get expensive and sometimes you don’t wanna wade through various options to find the lowest price. You just need the cheapest flight available and you don’t care who’s offering it.
Google added the tab to its Flights search engine that will cut your flight schedule search to the chase and just show you the “cheapest” options available, according to the official blog. So instead of wading through various fees and features, you can just view the cheapest options available from airlines and third-party airline booking sites.
The new feature is available starting today for US flights. Google will roll out the “cheapest” tab globally over the next few weeks.
The cheapest options for flights often involve what Google calls “creative itineraries” like longer than usual layovers and self-transfers from flight to flight. What we call them can’t be reprinted here. These inconveniences that make flights cheaper will now be listed under one tab.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-flights-now-has-a-cheapest-tab-190035611.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-flights-now-has-a-cheapest-tab-190035611.html?src=rss,"Wed, 16 Oct 2024 19:00:35 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
"Hades II's first major update adds a new region, main weapon and native Mac support","Hades II just got its first major update, which is all the reason I need to jump back into the inspired roguelite. Supergiant Games is calling the Olympic Update “practically mountain-sized”, likely because there’s a new region set in the mountains of Olympus.
With a new region, comes new story elements. The studio says “hours of new dialogue” has been added to the game. The area will also feature two new allies, but Supergiant remains mum on their identities. In other words, you’ll have to traverse Olympus to find out. I’d bet some Obol Points that they are Greek Gods of one type or another, given the region.
The update also includes a new main weapon, two animal companions and “dozens of new cosmetic items” to liven up Crossroads. There’s even a world map now, which will be displayed when moving from one region to another. That’s a small flourish, but a pretty fun one.
There are also dozens of quality-of-life improvements that’ll pop up throughout the game. These include faster weapon attacks, new special moves, a more responsive dash and a refined aiming system. Finally, the game now runs on Macs, so long as the computer boasts an Apple M1 chip or later.
Despite the boatload of new features, the game’s still in early access. Supergiant says this won’t be the last major content drop while still remaining in early access, as another big update hits early next year. So we have that to look forward to. The first game was in early access for nearly two years as it slowly transformed into the game we know and love today. Hades II has only been around five months.
For the uninitiated, Hades II is a roguelite hack-and-slash action game with fluid controls, a diverse array of upgrades and a story that expertly weaves itself into every unsuccessful run. There’s also a cute cat you can pal around with. It’s quite obviously a sequel to the mega-hit Hades, which was the first video game to ever win a Hugo Award.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/hades-iis-first-major-update-adds-a-new-region-main-weapon-and-native-mac-support-183541832.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/hades-iis-first-major-update-adds-a-new-region-main-weapon-and-native-mac-support-183541832.html?src=rss,"Wed, 16 Oct 2024 18:35:41 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
New Pixel updates include AI-powered theft protection,"Google is rolling out a slew of updates for Pixel watches, smartphones and tablets. In many cases, their predecessors are also getting the new features, such as Night Sight for Instagram — available on all Pixel 6 or newer devices, including A-series phones. The tool allows you to take photos directly on Instagram without worrying about them coming out dark. This could be ideal if you're someone who likes taking photos at concerts or parties without worrying about a bright flash going off. Other updates available for Pixel 6 or newer devices include astrophotography through Night Sight and theft protection.&nbsp;
Now globally available, theft protection one of the most expansive updates and actually applies to all Android 10 or newer devices (Android 15 is out today) — not just Pixel. Then, later this year, Google will release Identity Check, a feature that requires biometric authentication to access actions like changing your PIN and disabling theft protection.  The new feature includes tools like the AI-powered Theft Detection Lock, which uses on-device machine learning to detect possible attempts to steal your device and will automatically lock it if so. Additional features include Remote Lock, which lets you seal your device with just a verified phone number, and Offline Device Lock. You can watch a full overview of theft protection on Android's YouTube page.
Google released its latest lineup in August: the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro XL and Pixel 9 Pro and some of its newest features are exclusive to it. Such is the case for a Gemini extension for screenshots, a tool that lets you ""Hey Google"" your way to the exact image you're looking for. For example, you can say, ""Hey Google, use Screenshots to show to find the red shirt I saved."" Plus, you can now use a waterproof case to capture improved images and videos under the sea.&nbsp;
Update October 16, 1:51PM ET: Google initially indicated that Pixel A-series devices would not have access to the Night Sight for Instagram feature. However, it later confirmed — via Android reporter Mishaal Rahman — that ""Night Sight for Instagram is available on the Pixel 6 and later, including A-series.""This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/new-pixel-updates-include-ai-powered-theft-protection-160042706.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/new-pixel-updates-include-ai-powered-theft-protection-160042706.html?src=rss,"Wed, 16 Oct 2024 17:51:07 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
Riot Games is hyping up Arcane’s second and final season across its various titles,"Arcane season 2 is coming to Netflix on November 9, and Riot Games is drumming up the hype by releasing various content in its current and upcoming video game titles. All of this content will come out within the coming months.
Riot will release Ambessa Medarda, the Noxian general first seen in the show’s first season, as an upcoming Champion in League of Legends, Teamfight Tactics (TFT), League of Legends: Wild Rift, Valorant, and Legends of Runeterra.
In standard League of Legends news, the Bridge of Progress will become available in the ARAM game mode as part of an Arcane-themed update. Other additions include a Jinx skin of a new “Exalted” tier that will allow players to experience her Arcane story. It’s not the only skin as there will be an Arcane Brawler Vi skin and more.
TFT will introduce several Arcane characters as Champions, including Powder, with abilities based on what they have in the show. There will also be some cosmetics, including Arenas and Tacticians like Chibi Caitlyn. As for players who look forward to the PvE game mode Tocker’s Trials, they can rejoice as it’s making a return.
Singed and Warwick, two Champions available in Wild Rift, will receive gameplay updates. Previously announced Champion Heimerdinger will be made playable in Wild Rift after being playable in League of Legends and Legends of Runeterra. Warwick will also be playable in Legends of Runeterra. There won’t be much content beyond an Arcane-themed cosmetic bundle for Valorant.
While Riot’s fighting game 2XKO isn’t out yet, it will feature an Arcane-inspired Jinx skin. Said skin is coming on November 11. 2XKO will be released next year.
Of course, Riot isn’t confining the hype to its games. There will be merch coming out soon as November 9 approaches. Some of the products include apparel from Uniqlo and Blackmilk, collectibles from Funko and Tokidoki and Fenty Beauty makeup. If these aren’t enough to satisfy you, Riot promises plenty more is arriving.
Arcane season 2 is set to debut on Netflix on November 9, with Act One coming first. Act Two comes out on November 16, while Act Three will arrive on November 23. Keep your popcorn close at hand when the days come.

The JRPG-inspired Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has a stacked voice cast,"Sandfall Games just announced the voice cast for its forthcoming turn-based RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and it’s absolutely stacked. The actors include Andy Serkis and Charlie Cox, as a start. For the uninitiated, Serkis played a weird little guy named Gollum in some unknown movies about a magical ring. He also gave the iconic “one way out” monologue in Andor. Cox is best known for playing a masked vigilante called Daredevil.
The rest of the cast includes seasoned voice actors. There’s Ben Starr, who played a doctor in the TV show Jamestown but is perhaps best known for playing Clive in Final Fantasy XVI. Shala Nyx has plied her trade in plenty of recent games, including Cyberpunk 2077 and Diabolo IV. Other cast members include Jennifer English, who played Shadowheart in Baldur’s Gate 3, and Kirsty Rider.
For the uninitiated, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a JRPG-inspired fantasy epic with turn-based battles and a unique take on Belle Époque-era France. We got to see it in action earlier this year and came away (mostly) impressed. We called the graphics and environments “gorgeous” but the story “clear as mud.” However, it’s tough to nail down the narrative of a fantasy RPG just by watching a demo for a few hours.
In any event, we don’t have that long to wait before the game launches. The developers say it’ll come out in Spring 2025. It’ll be available for PC via Steam, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. It’s also a day one Game Pass title. If you simply can’t wait until then for a new game in the genre, we heartily recommend checking out Metaphor: ReFantazio.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-jrpg-inspired-clair-obscur-expedition-33-has-a-stacked-voice-cast-165228134.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-jrpg-inspired-clair-obscur-expedition-33-has-a-stacked-voice-cast-165228134.html?src=rss,"Wed, 16 Oct 2024 16:52:28 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
Panos Panay on launching his first products since moving to Amazon,"Panos Panay has a Diet Coke problem. It’s a topic that quickly came up when I walked into the small interview room, after he offered me a choice of beverages and I said my partner has a similar addiction. After a quick conversation on the advantages of drinking plain water over diet colas, I knew his wife, like me, advocates for less soda, but I still knew nothing of how much the man actually consumed a day.
It was Panay’s first launch event with members of the media since he left Microsoft last year to lead Amazon’s devices and services team. And the instant I walked into the event space at The Shed in New York, I thought “this feels like a Panos event.”
The room was drenched in sunlight, with various neutral and pastel pink couches and armchairs laid out in a vague semicircle facing an unassuming elevated platform. Around the stage were neatly planted assorted greenery with lavender and what looked like baby’s breath lending a general softness to the scene.
There was a leather stool on the stage that looked just big enough to perch on but not comfortable enough to actually rest, and next to it was a smaller wooden end table where a solo water bottle sat. Panay did not once sit during his 38-minute presentation. Clad in a black collared shirt, black jacket, black jeans and black shoes with a brown trim, Panay brought his typical sentimental delivery to the Kindle launch event.
As usual, he didn’t shy away from mentioning his family, showing a carefully taken picture of his daughter Bella reading a Kindle on a couch. He called out members of the media by name, saying hello to Lance Ulanoff in the front row and asking David Pierce if he could hear. At one point, he walked over to the middle row to hand a new Kindle off to tech Youtuber Jacklyn Dallas, asking her to tap repeatedly on the screen to scroll through pages and see for herself how much faster he believed it was.
Amazon
I say all this to impress on you that the Panos experience is one that’s inviting, engaging and can even lull you into feeling so charmed that you might overlook the fact that he repeatedly calls the Kindle Scribe a 2-in-1. It was certainly enough to give me more patience than I normally would have for a tech leader that had spent almost a third of his presentation talking about the Kindle’s history and where it fits into people’s lives. Instead of thinking “get on with it, I want to hear about the new devices without all this preamble,” I simply laughed at the jokes, made eye contact and related to the personal anecdotes. And though I knew we were past the 38 minutes he had promised the speech would last, I didn’t mind that he was still talking.
I was able to question him about 2-in-1s when we sat down to talk, though. The term brings to my mind the image of Surface tablets and iPads, not to mention the Surface Duo and Surface Neo that Panay launched at a remarkably similar Microsoft event years ago. Kindles? Not so much. But according to Panay, the Kindle Scribe “does two things, and it does it remarkably well. Turns out, it only does two things.”
People want to read on their Kindles, but they also want to write in books. “Both experiences have to stand on their own in a great way,” he added. “You can buy this device for writing, or you can buy this device for reading and then you can bridge it.”
But if a device tries to be too much, it might get too complicated. When I asked what was next for the Kindle Scribe and what challenges it faces, Panay said “You’ve got to be careful not to make it a Swiss army knife. That’s probably the biggest challenge — what it’s not gonna be.”
Panay explained that “at Amazon, the focus on the customers is off the charts,” saying the team talks to users, reads reviews and studies how people use their products to better understand needs. “Fundamentally, for this team, [it’s to] know what the customer needs, be passionate, make sure you deliver it.”
“Let’s not try and reinvent things that people don’t need reinvented.”
The approach Panay has brought over to Amazon is one that considers his history at Microsoft (and his entire life). He never explicitly mentions this, but I cannot help wondering if he’s learned anything from that company announcing the Surface Neo dual-screen laptop and not actually releasing it.
Panay also said that in getting to understand customers’ needs, Amazon also has to try to predict what they might want. “You also have to understand where the technology is headed and you have to have roadmaps,” he said. “You have to have invention and creation that sets you up for where it’s headed, so when people land, they have the next thing they need and hopefully it was your product that got them there.”
“Let’s not try and reinvent things that people don’t need reinvented.”Panos Panay
That desire to predict trends makes me nervous, especially at a time when every major company is rushing to stuff generative AI features into their products. How should companies like Amazon resist the urge to jump on bandwagons and avoid making products that ultimately are the result of useless hype? To Panay, the answer is patience.
“Patience is everything,” he said. “What is the right thing for the product at the right time? How is it useful? How is it elegant?” He acknowledged that “we’re at a time where AI for sure is transformational. This is not a fad.” There are things AI can bring to the Kindle Scribe and other products that could elevate them. But “making it useful for everyone is important to me, and making it simple.”
There are just two AI-based notebook features for the Kindle Scribe, and they basically read your scribbles and convert them to something more legible and digestible. They’re not groundbreaking concepts — I’ve seen at least 5 different companies launch summarization tools in the last year. But Panay made it clear through personal anecdotes on stage that these are important to him and his staff. He doesn’t want to let people see his handwritten notes, but he will let them see the version tidied up by AI. Whether the rest of the world’s Kindle users will find these helpful, I’m less certain.
For now, Panay wants to perfect the Kindle Scribe experience. “You can never make anything perfect, I’m never satisfied. But it’s so close right now… to feeling like paper, to feeling like an eraser, to feeling like you’re writing, to no distractions in your way.” He called it his favorite child during the presentation (but later saying that he felt guilty doing that).
There are plenty of other children in the Amazon hardware family that Panay oversees. He’s not only in charge of the four Kindles launched today, including the new color ereader called the Colorsoft, but the company’s smart home, robotaxi, satellite, consumer robots and Alexa products, as well as Fire TVs and tablets, too.
“It&#39;s an eclectic group of products at some level, but it&#39;s actually quite a connected one at the same time.” There’s also stuff that Panay couldn’t yet talk about on the record, but he said there’s “so much magic yet to be shared with the world.” In a more realistic manner of speaking, it’s about seeing these things “connected in a way that can make a difference for people’s lives every day in their homes and outside of the home.”
Cherlynn Low for Engadget
There are other ways the Kindle Scribe could evolve that wouldn’t be a stretch of the imagination, either. The most obvious is getting a color display, and Panay agreed “it’s not a stretch at all, probably” before going on to say he can’t discuss future roadmaps. But I can certainly speculate.
While it’s interesting to see Amazon come up with a whole new name for the Colorsoft, indicating that it’ll perhaps be a separate product line, it would make sense for the Colorsoft to be a one-off and for the color panels to get integrated into other existing Kindles in future.
Another potential technological change to Kindles is making them foldable. To that end, Panay simply said “It’s an interesting concept.” When I pointed out that he’s no stranger to folding devices, he acknowledged “I’m definitely not,” before adding that “we have a ton of concepts in the lab.”
Crucially, though, he reiterates he doesn&#39;t “want to create tech for the sake of creating tech.” If the idea is right, Panay is open to considering it. “But right now, keeping it simple is where we’re at.”This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/panos-panay-on-launching-his-first-products-since-moving-to-amazon-163024504.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/panos-panay-on-launching-his-first-products-since-moving-to-amazon-163024504.html?src=rss,"Wed, 16 Oct 2024 16:30:24 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
The first of Astro Bot’s free speedrunning levels arrives on Thursday,"Astro Bot, one of Sony’s greatest triumphs, is getting new content for those who live life (or at least play PS5) in the fast lane. Developer Team Asobi said on Wednesday that the first of five free speedrunning levels teased at Sony’s September State of Play will arrive on Thursday, October 17.
The first speedrun level is Building Speed, where you’ll get an assist from your robot bulldog friend Barkster. Team Asobi promises you’ll “blast your way through a sky-high city.” Dodging cranes, smashing through crates and zipping through a flying car wash are part of the festivities. It sounds like more of the cute, 3D-platforming fun that Engadget’s Jessica Conditt described as the equivalent of  “Super Mario Bros. for a new generation of video game fanatics.”
Team Asobi / Sony
After tomorrow’s first level, a new speedrunning stage will arrive on each of the following four Thursdays. That includes Let it Slide on October 24, Spring-loaded Run on October 31, Helium Heights on November 7 and Rising Heat on November 14.
The speedrun levels are all free. You should see them starting at 9AM ET on their launch dates.
Each level will add two new bots to rescue. Team Asobi has already teased nods to Eve from Stellar Blade and the Helldivers, but you can expect more fun surprises beyond those.
Team Asobi sounds like it has more content on tap. In its announcement blog post, the developers invited you to stay tuned because “there may be even more surprises coming soon” for Sony’s latest PlayStation-exclusive success story.

"FTC ratifies 'click-to-cancel' rule, making it easier for consumers to end subscriptions","The Federal Trade Commission has made it easier for consumers to cancel subscriptions. In a decision that went down along party lines, the agency voted to ratify a “click-to-cancel” rule that will require providers to make it as easy to cancel a subscription as it is to sign up for one. First proposed last year, the rulemaking prohibits companies from misrepresenting their recurring services and memberships, as well as failing to clearly disclose any material terms related to those offerings.
“Too often, businesses make people jump through endless hoops just to cancel a subscription,” said Chair Lina Khan. “The FTC’s rule will end these tricks and traps, saving Americans time and money. Nobody should be stuck paying for a service they no longer want.”
After considering more than 16,000 comments on the matter, the FTC decided not to write the final rulemaking as originally proposed. Most notably, the agency scrapped a proposal that would have required companies to provide consumers with annual reminders for subscription renewals. It also won’t mandate a rule that would have forced sellers to obtain the consent of those seeking to cancel a subscription before telling them about potential modifications to their plan or reasons why they should continue paying for a service.
No American should have to worry about being tricked into buying subscriptions and memberships – or staying in either against their will.Today, my Administration is taking action to ensure folks don&#39;t have to jump through hoops to cancel them. https://t.co/3TJFi362vh— President Biden (@POTUS) October 16, 2024
 
A separate statement issued by Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter (PDF link) provides insight into the decision. Essentially, the agency felt the FTC Act doesn’t give it the authority to require a renewal notice. I’ll note here that the dissenting opinion (PDF link), written by Republican Commissioner Melissa Holyoak, contends that the entire rulemaking is overly broad, and accuses the Democratic majority of attempting to push through the change before next month&#39;s election.
“Americans understand the importance and value of such a requirement; many have discovered that they or their parents had been paying for years or even decades for a service wholly unused, such as a dial-up internet service from the 1990s,” Slaughter writes in her statement. “… Of course, we are always mindful that our authority under the FTC Act to issue rules under section 18 has limits; sometimes, as here, those limits prevent us from codifying in a rule practices that we might, as a matter of policy, prefer to require explicitly.”
Slaughter points out that state and federal lawmakers do have the authority to mandate renewal notices, and notes some states, such as Virginia, have even recently gone down that path. “The comment record compiled in this rulemaking proceeding strongly supports the wisdom of federal and state legislators’ carefully considering adopting such a law,” Slaughter writes.
Provided there’s no legal challenge to the FTC’s decision, today’s rulemaking will go into effect 180 days after it is published in the Federal Register. When the agency moved to ban noncompete clauses earlier this year, a federal judge in Texas issued a nationwide injunction. That decision is still stuck in legal limbo.&nbsp;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ftc-ratifies-click-to-cancel-rule-making-it-easier-for-consumers-to-end-subscriptions-160752238.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ftc-ratifies-click-to-cancel-rule-making-it-easier-for-consumers-to-end-subscriptions-160752238.html?src=rss,"Wed, 16 Oct 2024 16:07:54 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
Microsoft removes the $1 Xbox Game Pass trial just before Call of Duty: Black Ops 6,"Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is just around the corner, with a release date of October 25, and Microsoft has temporarily removed the $1 Xbox Game Pass 14-day trial from stores —‚ again. Some gamers may remember that Microsoft pulled a similar stunt last year just before Starfield’s release. Essentially, this keeps players from trying out a big new release like Black Ops 6 without paying for a full subscription.
The trial’s removal happened on October 8, but it was only caught by The Verge today. The most likely primary reason is to prevent gamers from playing through the campaign without paying the full price. Of course, even millions of $1 sales wouldn’t be profitable for Microsoft.
A decision like this isn’t without reasons, as Microsoft is hoping to increase the number of Game Pass subscriptions. Since the number of new subscribers over the last two years has slowed, Microsoft hopes that removing the trial forces gamers to purchase a full Game Pass plan to enjoy Black Ops 6.
The Game Pass trial isn’t back yet, so those who want to dip their toes into the water before plunging in will have to wait. It’s also good to remember that the trial used to be for a whole month before its current 14-day form.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/microsoft-removes-the-1-xbox-game-pass-trial-just-before-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-155049730.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/microsoft-removes-the-1-xbox-game-pass-trial-just-before-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-155049730.html?src=rss,"Wed, 16 Oct 2024 15:50:49 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
Airbnb now lets hosts hire other hosts to manage properties,"Hosting a property on Airbnb is no longer a simple process. Customers can be finicky, ideal pricing can change on a dime, markets can become flooded and earnings can be difficult to track. The platform’s trying to simplify matters by introducing the Co-Host Network, which allows hosts to hire other hosts to manage properties.
Here’s how it works. Property owners can peruse the network for other hosts and scoop them up into a loving embrace of hospitality. The hired hosts can help with just about anything, including setting up listings, selecting prices and availability, cleaning, maintenance and guest management. It’s a disruption of the blazing-hot “building superintendent” industry.
Airbnb
These hosts for hire must be highly rated and local, with Airbnb saying it has only included hosts with a rating of at least 4.8 and a minimum of ten hosted stays. The would-be co-hosts/employees can set their own service rates on a profile page. The company says it has onboarded over 10,000 people so far, in countries like Australia, Brazil, France, Mexico and the US.
“One of the requests that we had from hosts is that they would really love to be able to find professional, high-quality co-hosts with a great track record in their area whom they can trust. And they can really be completely hands-off,” Judson Coplan, VP of Product Marketing at Airbnb, said to TechCrunch.
While this feature should be a boon for actual people who just need a little bit of help, the phrase “completely hands-off” gives me pause. It seems like it could easily be used by gigantic real estate monoliths that own hundreds and hundreds of properties across the platform.
This isn’t a bad thing, per se, as these mega-hosts are generally considered to be a reliable option for guests. However, this certainly doesn’t help the public perception that Airbnb and its ilk participate in the hollowing out of neighborhoods, turning them into ghost towns. There is, after all, a housing crisis across the country.
In any event, this could be a decent way for some people to make a few extra bucks. Airbnb introduced other stuff besides the Co-Host Network, including a feature for hosts to check out similar listings in an area. As for guests, there’s a new welcome tour in the app for first time users, updated search filters, local payment options and more.
The platform has been busy lately. Earlier this year, Airbnb started a program to provide discounts on EV chargers for hosts. It also now allows the app to display smart lock codes to guests.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/airbnb-now-lets-hosts-hire-other-hosts-to-manage-properties-153748730.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/apps/airbnb-now-lets-hosts-hire-other-hosts-to-manage-properties-153748730.html?src=rss,"Wed, 16 Oct 2024 15:37:48 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
"Analogue’s 4K remake of the N64 is almost ready, and it’s a big deal","A year after it was first teased, Analogue says it’s nailed its most complicated project yet: rebuilding the Nintendo 64 from scratch. The Analogue 3D will ship in Q1 2025 — it was originally slated for 2024 — and pre-orders start on October 21 at $250. 
Like all of the company’s machines, the Analogue 3D has an FPGA (field programmable gate array) chip coded to emulate the original console on a hardware level. Analogue promises support for every official N64 cartridge ever released, across all regions, with no slowdown or inaccuracies. If it achieves that goal, the Analogue 3D will be the first system in the world to perfectly emulate the N64, though other FPGA and software emulators get pretty close. 
The company has been selling recreations of retro consoles for over a decade, starting with high-end, bespoke takes on the Neo-Geo and NES. Over time it’s gradually shifted over to more mass-market (though still high-end) productions, with versions of SNES, Genesis and Game Boy all coming in at around the $200 mark. All of the company’s systems support original physical media, rather than ROMs. 
Analogue’s original unique selling point was its use of FPGA chips. Rather than using software emulation to play ROMs, Analogue programs FPGA “cores” to emulate original console hardware, and its consoles support original game media and controllers. Compared with software emulation (especially in the early ’10s when Analogue got started), FPGA-based consoles are more accurate, and don’t suffer from as much input lag. 
FPGA emulation has come a long way over the past decade. Where Analogue was once the only route into the world of FPGAs for most people, there’s now a rich community of developers and hardware manufacturers involved. The open-source MiSTer project, for example, has accurately emulated almost every video game thing produced up to the mid ’90s. And plenty of smaller manufacturers are now selling FPGA hardware for very reasonable prices. The FPGBC is one good example: It’s a simple DIY kit that lets you build a modern-day Game Boy Color for a much lower price than an Analogue Pocket.

Amid all these developments, Analogue occupies a strange spot in the retro gaming community, which has evolved into an open-source, people-powered movement to preserve and play old games. It produces undeniably great hardware that doesn’t require expertise to use, but its prices are high, and its limited-run color variants of consoles like the Pocket have both created FOMO in the community and been a consistent target for scalpers. Analogue is, in many ways, the Apple of the retro gaming hardware space. 
With that said, it’s hard to deny that the Pocket has brought more players into the retro gaming world and attracted talent to FPGA development. And if Analogue comes through on its promise here, the Analogue 3D will be another huge moment for video game preservation, and could be the spark for another half-decade of fantastic achievements from the FPGA community at large. 
Breaking the fifth-gen barrier 
While the FPGA emulation of the first few video game generations is largely a solved problem, there’s a huge leap in complexity between the fourth generation (SNES, Genesis, etc.) and the next. Strides have been made to rebuild the PlayStation, Saturn and N64 in FPGA, but there is no core for any fifth-gen console that has fully solved the puzzle. The current state of the MiSTer N64 core is pretty impressive, with almost every US game counted as playable, but very few games are considered to run flawlessly. 
So how did Analogue solve this? The studio does have a talented team, but it importantly has a leg-up when it comes to hardware. The Analogue 3D has the strongest version of the Intel Cyclone 10GX FPGA chip, with 220,000 logic elements. For context, the MiSTer project’s open-source DE-10 board has a Cyclone V FPGA with 110,000 logic elements, while the Analogue Pocket’s main FPGA offers 49,000 elements. There’s a lot more to an FPGA than its logic elements, but the numbers are illustrative: The 3D’s FPGA is undoubtedly the most powerful Analogue has ever used, which clearly gave it more flexibility in designing its core. 
While we can’t verify Analogue’s claim of 100 percent compatibility by looking at a spec sheet, the company does have a good track record of programming fantastic FPGA cores, so it’s likely it’ll get incredibly close.

Of course, if you just wanted to play N64 games accurately, you could plug an N64 into any TV with a composite or S-Video connector, or use one of many boxes that converts those formats into HDMI signals that modern TVs require. 
The problem with running an N64 on a modern TV is that its games run at a wide range of resolutions, typically from 320 x 240 up to (very rarely) 640 x 480, the max output. There are countless oddball resolutions between, and some games run below 320 x 240. This is a nightmare for modern displays. Some will scale to a full screen very nicely — both of the common resolutions I listed multiply neatly to 4K, albeit with pillarboxing. The situation gets more confusing with PAL cartridges, which can run at fun horizontal resolutions like 288 and 576. There’s also the issue that the vast majority of these games were designed with the CRT displays of old in mind, taking advantage of the quirks of scanlines to, say, make a checkerboard pattern look translucent. 
This makes playing N64 games on a modern TV a bit of a hassle. There are fantastic retro upscalers like the RetroTINK series, but when plugging in a game for the first time, you wind up deciding between integer and “good enough” scaling, dealing with weird frame rates and tweaking blending options to get the picture just right. Many people enjoy this fine-tuning and customization aspect, and all power to you! But it's undoubtedly a barrier to entry, and much of the hard work done on upscaling has been focused on 2D gaming, rather than 3D. 
Analogue says its scaling solution will solve many of these issues. The Analogue 3D supports 4K output, variable refresh rate displays, and PAL and NTSC carts. On top of those basics, it’s building out “Original Display Modes” to emulate the CRT TVs and PVMs of old. Calling ODMs filters feels a little reductive, as they’re a complicated and customizable mix of display tricks, but essentially you pick one and it changes the way the picture looks, so…. 
ODMs were used effectively on the Analogue Pocket to emulate various Game Boy displays. Perhaps the most impressive example is a Trinitron ODM that came to the Pocket in 2023 that, when used with the Analogue Dock, does a pretty incredible job of turning a modern TV into a high-end Sony tube TV. We don’t have a ton of information on which ODMs are coming to the 3D, but I will share the very ’90s ad for the feature below: 
 
 
 
  Analogue
 
 
The final piece of the image-quality puzzle is frame rate. The N64’s library is full of some spectacularly slow games. My memory may be scarred from growing up in a PAL region, which meant, while the US and Japan’s NTSC consoles were outputting a blistering 20 fps, I was chugging away at 16.66 fps. But even in the idealized NTSC world, lots of games outright missed their frame rate targets comically often. As an example, the majority of Goldeneye’s single-player campaign plays out between 15-25 fps, while a four-player match would typically see half that number. And let’s not speak of Perfect Dark. 
These glacial frame rates are far less noticeable on a CRT than they are on modern displays with crisp rows of pixels updating from top to bottom. While the ODMs go some way to replicating the feel of an old TV, they can’t change the underlying technical differences. The Analogue 3D does support variable refresh rate output, but that won't do much when a game is running at 12 fps, and instead is intended to help the system run like the original N64 did at launch.&nbsp; 
In its initial press push last year, Analogue told Paste magazine that you’ll have the option to overclock the 3D’s virtual chips to run faster — ""overclocking, running smoother, eliminating native frame dips"" — but the company hasn't mentioned that in its final press release. Instead, Analogue CEO Christopher Taber told Engadget that its solution ""isn't overclocking, it's much better and more sophisticated."" It revolves around Nintendo's original Rambus RAM set up, which is often the bottleneck for N64 performance. Solving this bottleneck ""means that games can run without slowdown and all the classic issues the original N64 had,"" he explained.&nbsp; 
By default, though, the Analogue 3D is set up to run exactly like original hardware, albeit with the RAM Expansion Pak attached. ""Preserving the original hardware is the number one goal,"" Taber explained. ""Even when bandwidth is increased, it’s not about boosting performance beyond the system’s original capabilities — it’s about giving players a clearer window into how the games were designed to run.""&nbsp; 
 
 
 
  Analogue
 
 
The hardware 
Analogue has a rich history of making very pretty hardware, and the Analogue 3D is clearly no exception. As with the Super Nt, Mega Sg, and Duo, the 3D calls back to the basic form of the console it’s based on, while smoothing out and modernizing it somewhat. It’s an elegant way to pull on nostalgia while also being legally distinct enough to avoid a lawsuit. (Analogue’s FPGA cores and software also don’t infringe on any Nintendo IP.) 
The Analogue 3D has a similar shape to the N64, but the front pillars have been erased, the four controller ports match the housing and the power/reset buttons are slanted inwards to point toward the cartridge slot. Despite the tweaks, it still undoubtedly evokes a Nintendo 64. Around the back, you’ll find a USB-C port for power, two USB ports for accessories like non-standard controllers, an HDMI port and a full-sized SD card slot. 
 
 
 
  Analogue
 
 
A new operating system from Analogue, 3DOS, will debut with the system. It looks like a blend of the AnalogueOS that debuted on the Pocket and the Nintendo Switch OS, with the homescreen centered on a large carousel of square cards. The screenshots Analogue provided show options for playing a cartridge, browsing your library or viewing save states and screenshots. Some N64 games have the ability to save data to the cartridge, while others rely on a Controller Pak, but the ability to quickly save progress as a memory, as introduced with the Pocket, will be useful nonetheless. 3DOS can also connect to the internet over the console’s built-in WiFi chip for OS updates, which is a first for Analogue. 
While you can browse your library in 3DOS, you won’t actually be able to load any game that isn’t physically inserted into the cartridge slot: The Analogue 3D only plays original media. It’s also worth noting that the Analogue 3D also doesn’t have an “openFPGA” setup like the Analogue Pocket did, which opened the door to playing with a wild array of cores that emulate various consoles, computers and arcades. It doesn’t usually take long for someone to jailbreak Analogue consoles to play ROMs (or other cores) via the system’s SD card slot, but this is not officially supported or sanctioned by Analogue. 
The console comes with a power supply (with a US plug), USB cable, an HDMI cable and a 16GB SD card. As per usual, no controller will be packed in — it’s up to you if you want to use original hardware or something more modern. I managed to make at least one reader extremely mad (I’m sorry, Brucealeg) last time I wrote about the Analogue 3D and called the N64 controller a mistake. Personally, though, it feels really rough using one in 2024. 
 
 
 
  Analogue/8BitDo
 
 
If you enjoy the three-paddled original controller, the 3D has four ports for you, and the system will also support the myriad Paks that plug into those controllers. For everyone else, there's Bluetooth Classic and LE support along with two USB ports for wired controllers. Accessory maker 8BitDo has created what seems to be a variant of its Ultimate controller specifically for the Analogue 3D. (Analogue's CEO, Taber, is also 8BitDo’s CMO, and the companies have collaborated on controllers for many consoles at this point.)&nbsp; 
The 8BitDo controller looks like a fairly happy middle ground between old and new, with an octagonal gate around the thumbstick, and nicely raised and sized C-buttons. It has a Rumble Pak built in, which works on both the Analogue 3D and Nintendo Switch. It’s available in black or white hues that match the console, and sells separately for $39.99. 
Pre-orders for the Analogue 3D open on October 21 at 11AM ET, with an estimated ship date of Q1 2025. It’s unclear how many will be available, but if past launches are any indication, you should be ready to click buy as close to 11AM as possible if you want a hope of being in the first wave of shipments.

Adobe's latest sneak previews of upcoming features include AI sound generation and image remixing,"Yesterday, Adobe announced its new Firefly Video Model, a generative AI model for video editing developed by the company, along with Generative Extend, a Premiere Pro feature. Today, Adobe is teasing some experimental photo and video editing tools for PhotoShop and Premiere Pro. Since they’re part of Adobe’s “sneaks” previews, they’re still being tested and no launch dates are available.
There are a total of nine features, and we’ll start with Project Perfect Blend for PS, which improves natural blending and makes shadow casting more realistic, creating more lifelike images. Project Clean Machine removes photo flashes, fireworks and objects blocking the camera’s view.
One feature that stands out is Project In Motion, which lets users transform custom shape animations into video by entering a prompt, while Project Know How is a content authenticator tool that can search for a video file’s source online.
Project Turntable lets users rotate 2D vector art in 3D, thereby allowing the 2D vector art to face a direction of their choice. The generative AI model fills in any blanks to create presentable 3D vector art.
Another standout tool is Project Super Sonic, which generates sound effects via prompts or clicking on objects in a video. The latter method can create sounds without typing prompts into the generative AI model. Project Super Sonic seems helpful for people looking to design the sounds they want.
Adobe is also working on Microsoft Copilot integration in Project Scenic. This tool creates 3D scene layouts using Copilot prompts, and the camera and objects in the layout can be tweaked.
Project Remix A Lot leverages generative AI to create images in various shapes and sizes, all fully editable. In other words, users can “remix” creations into shapes they like, including unusual ones.
Finally, we have Project Hi-Fi. With this tool, it’s possible to transform sketches and concepts into high-quality images. These images can easily be dragged into PhotoShop for editing.
If you’re curious about Adobe’s latest Sneaks, you can see and hear more about them all over on Adobe’s YouTube page.

Uber Eats will now let users create and share lists of their favorite meals,"Uber Eats is adding a social element to ordering delivery tacos in the form of curated lists. Garden variety users can whip up one of these lists on the Account tab, pulling menu items from preferred local haunts.
All lists are shareable by default, so users can send them to friends and family. I don’t want other people to know the shameful food I gorge while endlessly watching episodes of Frasier, but maybe that’s just me.
This could actually prove useful for certain scenarios, such as when you’re sick in bed and want someone else to handle takeout. Just point friends and family to the list. Uber Eats also said that there’s a chance any particular list could end up on the home feed, turning the creator into a local food influencer for the day.
Speaking of food influencers, the app will also feature curated lists by pseudo-celebrities. Uber Eats is advertising initial participation by Sam Roby of Chicago Food Authority, Ella Kahan and Emma Matarasso of Chew York City and others. It remains to be seen how this will work in smaller markets.
Uber Eats has been making changes all over the place lately. The platform recently began to offer fresh produce from farmers markets in select cities.

"Amazon plans to build small, modular nuclear reactors","Amazon has announced three new agreements to build small modular reactors (SMRs). These nuclear reactors are smaller than traditional ones, allowing them to be closer to the grid and be built faster. Microsoft and Google have recently announced their own investments into nuclear power.&nbsp;
One of the agreements works towards developing four SMRs with Energy Northwest, a Washington-based consortium of state public utilities. It should initially generate about 320 megawatts, with the potential to reach 960 megawatts. The second is with X-energy, which is providing an advanced nuclear reactor design for Energy Northwest&#39;s undertaking. On the opposite coast, Amazon is working with Dominion Energy to investigate whether the development of an SMR project is possible near the utility company&#39;s existing nuclear power station in Virginia. It could bring 300 megawatts of power to the area.&nbsp;
Amazon shared further information about these developments in a video shared to YouTube. Amazon also claims these agreements will bring new jobs, with Energy Northwest, for example, reporting the agreement will lead to 1,000 temporary construction jobs and 100 or so permanent jobs upon completion.
This summer, Amazon announced it had reached its goal of matching its worldwide energy consumption with renewable energy sources seven years ahead of its 2030 goal. However, some Amazon employees and environmental experts accused the company of &quot;distorting the truth&quot; as the claim relies on billions of dollars in investments to solar and wind initiatives. The problem? These sources aren&#39;t exclusively used by Amazon, instead funnelling into a general power grid.&nbsp;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazon-plans-to-build-small-modular-nuclear-reactors-135335184.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/amazon-plans-to-build-small-modular-nuclear-reactors-135335184.html?src=rss,"Wed, 16 Oct 2024 13:53:36 +0000",Sports,www.engadget.com
Amazon's new Kindle Paperwhite reader has a larger screen and faster page turns,"Amazon's latest version of its popular Kindle Paperwhite has arrived, marking the sixth iteration if you're keeping score at home. The new model is the thinnest Paperwhite yet and has a refreshed 7-inch screen that's a touch larger than the previous model's 6.8-inch display. It also has the highest contrast of any Kindle thanks to the oxide thin-film transistor display tech.&nbsp; 
Amazon boosted the speed as well, promising 25 percent faster page turns. It's waterproof as before but uses a new material with a premium soft touch grip. The Kindle Paperwhite comes with 16 GB of storage and is available in three colors, Raspberry, Jade and Black. It's now available at Amazon for $160. 
As before, the company also released a premium version with more bells and whistles, the Paperwhite Signature Editing. Storage doubles on that model to 32 GB and it features an auto-adjusting front light along with optional wireless charging. The Paperwhite Signature Edition comes in Metallic Raspberry, Metallic Jade and Metallic Black for $200.&nbsp;

If it's a budget reader you're after, Amazon has refreshed the entry-level Kindle, too. The new 12th-generation model comes with an updated 6-inch screen, offering a higher contrast ratio for more legible text, plus a front light that's 25 percent brighter at the maximum setting. It also gets a performance update that boosts page turning speeds. It comes in black or a new ""Matcha"" color and is now on sale for $110.&nbsp; 
Along with those models, Amazon also unveiled its first color Kindle, the Colorsoft, that could be ideal for graphic novels and other digital color-oriented content. It promises ""rich, paper-like color"" using an oxide backplane display, plus high contrast on both color and black-and-white content. It's now on pre-order for $280 with shipping set for October 30th. Finally, Amazon is releasing its second Kindle Scribe reader that doubles as a note-taking device (not unlike the reMarkable tablets). It'll arrive on December 4, but you can pre-order it now for $400.&nbsp;

Kindle Scribe hands-on: You can scribble on your books,"Seventeen years is an odd anniversary to call out. But at an event launching four new Kindles, Amazon’s head of devices and services Panos Panay reminded a group of media that “Kindle is 17 years in the making, almost to the day.” Panay added that the device is currently seeing its highest sales numbers, and that 20.8 billion pages are read each month on a Kindle. But people aren’t just reading on Kindles. Since the introduction of the Kindle Scribe in 2022, there has been even more development in e-paper writing tablets, with a notable recent product in the reMarkable Paper Pro. While that $580 device supports a color writing experience, Amazon’s Kindle Scribe still only works in black and white. But it might offer enough by way of software updates to make up for its monochrome manner. 
Plus, being able to write on what’s already a popular ereader makes that book-like experience even more realistic, and the Kindle Scribe represents what Panay called the “fastest growing category” of Kindles. You could almost call it a 2-in-1, since it’s an ereader and writing tablet at once. “I have a lot of passion around 2-in-1s,” Panay said at his presentation, and he used that term repeatedly to describe the Kindle Scribe. I haven’t thought about it that way, but I was less worried about semantics and more about how the Kindle Scribe and its new features felt at a hand-on session yesterday. 
I’m the sort of person that needs to physically write out something while I plan a project. Whether it’s lofty goals to get my life together or draft up a strategy for covering certain software releases at work, my hands grasp at the air for an imaginary pen and paper. For that reason, the Kindle Scribe and other writing tablets call out to me. I reviewed the original Kindle Scribe almost two years ago and since then Amazon has slowly expanded the feature set and made the device more useful. 
With the original Scribe, Amazon got a lot of the basics right. The latency and smoothness of the writing experience were close to feeling like pen and paper, and the device felt sturdy and slick. The new Scribe felt very similar in that sense, with little noticeable difference in the way the stylus interacted with the screen, and I didn’t encounter any jarring lag in the brief time I had with it. 
Where the Scribe left me wanting more was software, and that’s also the area Amazon appears to have focused on this year. Don’t get me wrong — it’s not like the company didn’t tweak the hardware. There are some refinements like new white borders, a smaller grip, different color options and an updated stylus with a soft-tip top that feels more like a conventional eraser.

But inside the device lie the more intriguing changes. Most significant in my opinion is the new Active Canvas. It directly addresses one of my biggest complaints in my review, which is that the writing experience within books and publications was a little wonky. 
To quote myself, this was what I said in 2022: “You can also take down notes when you’re reading an e-book. But it’s not like you can scribble directly onto the words of your e-books. You can use the floating toolbox to create a sticky note, then draw within a designated rectangle. When you close the sticky note, a small symbol appears over the word it was attached to, but otherwise, your scribbles are hidden. No annotating in the margins here.” 
All of that has changed with the new Kindle Scribe. When you’re in an e-book, you can now just start writing on the page, and a box will appear, containing your scribbles. You no longer need to first find the floating toolbox and select the sticky note tool. Just write. It’s so much simpler, and in the Kindle Scribe I played with it worked almost instantly. Not only is the box embedded within the text, with the book’s words rearranging and flowing to accommodate it, but you can also resize the rectangle to take up however much space you like. The rest of the page will reflow to make room as necessary. I was particularly impressed by how quickly this happened on the demo unit — it was more responsive than switching between notebooks on my existing Scribe. 
Plus, the box containing your note will stay in place instead of being hidden and replaced by a small symbol. It’s clear that Amazon’s earlier implementation was a rudimentary workaround to allow people to write on fixed format media, whereas the new approach is more deeply integrated and thought out. 
And unlike what I said two years ago, you can now annotate in a new collapsible margin. Tapping the top right corner brings up options to pull up the column, and you can choose from having it take up about a quarter of the width or spread out to about three quarters. Content in the margin will be scrollable, so you theoretically won’t run out of space.

Now, this isn’t a perfect replica of annotating on a real textbook, but it might be better since you won’t have to scrawl all around the borders or write upside down just to squeeze in your thoughts. I’m not sure yet, as I really need to spend more time with it to know, but I like that Amazon clearly has taken in feedback and thought about how to add these requested features. 
The company also added the ability to use the Pen and directly highlight or underline within those books, and pretty much any Kindle title will support most of these features. They’d have to be content that allows for font resizing, to start, so things like PDFs, which are fixed, won’t work with the Active Canvas. Word documents are compatible as well. 
I spend more time writing in blank notebooks than in actual books, and for those scenarios, Amazon is using generative AI in two new tools: Summarization and Refined Writing. The former is pretty straightforward. If you’ve handwritten 10 pages worth of brainstorming meeting notes, the system can scan all of it and collate just the highlights. You can have this be added as a page to the existing notebook as a summary, or save it as a separate document on its own. 
Refined Writing, meanwhile, is like Apple’s Handwriting Assist on iPadOS 18 but on a larger scale. While Apple’s software feels like it’s about nipping and tucking stray words that are out of alignment, Amazon’s takes your entire handwritten page and converts it into text in a script-like font. This works best if you tend to write in a single column with clear indentations and paragraphs. I tend to draw random boxes all over the place for breakout thoughts, and the system will not perfectly replicate that. For example, a two-column shopping list I quickly drafted on a demo Scribe was merged into one, and the checkboxes I drew were interpreted as capital letter Ds that were inserted at the start of every bullet. 
 
 
 
  Amazon
 
 
It might not seem immediately useful, but if you’re the sort of person that’s shy about their handwriting, this could save you some shame. More importantly, it can make you writing more legible in case you need to share, say, your screenplay treatment with a production partner. Or if your scrawled shopping list just isn’t making sense to your partner. I also like that even after you’ve converted your notes into text, you can still erase them using the top of the pen and make edits. You’ll have to run Refined Writing again to regenerate a neatly formatted page. Oh, and I appreciate the flexibility you get here. You’ll have a few fonts and sizes to choose from, and can select the pages you want to reformat or have the entire book done up altogether. 
None of the notebook features are destructive, meaning you’ll usually be able to retain your original written content and save the generated material as addendums. The AI work is done in the cloud, with your data being encrypted throughout the process. The Kindle Scribe also displays an animated page showing it’s busy with the generative AI task, which in my experience so far took at least 10 seconds. It might be different on the original Kindle Scribe, which will also be getting these software features either later this year or, in the case of the expandable margins, in early 2025 when it arrives on the new Kindle Scribe. 
In its 17 years, the Kindle has done a lot to disrupt physical books, and since the introduction of the Scribe, it’s been poised to do the same for notebooks. As someone who’s relished being able to carry around the equivalent of a thousand books in a super thin device, the idea of replacing a bunch of notebooks with a Scribe is immensely intriguing. Amazon does find itself up against some stiff competition from reMarkable and Boox, but it has its sheer size and the power of its Kindle library in its favor. The Kindle Scribe will be available in December for a starting price of $400, and I hope to have a review unit in soon enough to see if I love or hate the new annotation and AI features.

Amazon's Kindle Colorsoft is its first color ereader,"Amazon has launched its first ever ereader with a color display, in addition to the latest versions of the other models in its Kindle lineup. The company says it designed the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition to deliver ""rich, paper-like color."" You'll be able to see book covers, images, comics and graphic novels as authors intended on the device, and you'll be able to highlight passages in colored markers instead of in the usual gray.&nbsp; 
Since it is a Kindle, and you're mostly going to use it to read, Amazon made sure that the device has a good color and a good black-and-white experience. It promises high contrast, high resolution and high clarity whether you're looking at a full color image or a black-and-white page. Zooming in on images will not make them look pixelated, Amazon says. Based on what we'd seen at the company's event for the new ereaders, the model does deliver accurate colors. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' green skin and different-colored eye masks looked accurate in the comic book we looked at, even under direct sunlight or the orange lights in the event.&nbsp; 
The model is pretty much the new Paperwhite Signature Edition with a different display, and that one promises 25 percent faster page turns than the previous iteration. However, putting a color display on an ereader can slow it down, lessen its contrast ratio and drain its battery life faster. To make up for that, Amazon made some hardware and software changes, such as using nitride LEDs that work with the company's algorithm to enhance color and brightness without washing out images. Its custom coding focuses the light through each pixel so that colors don't blend together on the screen.&nbsp; 
The Colorsoft is the first Kindle with a color display, but it's not the first color e-ink product. There's the reMarkable Paper Pro, for instance, which you can write on in colored digital pens. You can't write on the Colorsoft like you can on the Paper Pro (or the Kindle Scribe), but it is cheaper: It's now available for pre-order for $280 and will start shipping on October 30.&nbsp;

Prada reveals its spacesuit for NASA's Artemis III mission,"Last October, Axiom Space and Prada partnered to create a new spacesuit for NASA&#39;s Artemis III mission — it&#39;s first crewed venture to the moon since Apollo 17 in 1972. One year later, the pair has revealed a first look at the Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit (AxEMU) spacesuit during Milan&#39;s International Astronautical Congress. The suit is white with red and gray accents that admittedly does look chicer than a typical spacesuit.&nbsp;
The pair claims the new spacesuit&#39;s design improves on flexibility, can manage an eight hour spacewalk and will sustain two hours of the lunar south pole&#39;s coldest temperatures. &quot;Prada’s design and product development team worked alongside Axiom Space engineers on customized material recommendations and features that would both protect astronauts against the unique challenges of the lunar environment and visually inspire future space exploration,&quot; the companies said in a joint statement.&nbsp;
The suit is almost finished, having undergone testing and simulations at Axiom Space, SpaceX and NASA facilities. It should enter a final review in 2025, following completion of the remaining evaluations. NASA initially planned to launch Artemis III in 2025 and pushed it to at least September 2026 early this year. The space agency originally awarded Axiom with the mission in 2022.&nbsp;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/prada-reveals-its-spacesuit-for-nasas-artemis-iii-mission-123014149.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/prada-reveals-its-spacesuit-for-nasas-artemis-iii-mission-123014149.html?src=rss,"Wed, 16 Oct 2024 12:30:14 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
How to stream via a VPN on Roku,"The Roku smart TV platform is an accessible way to watch your favorite streaming content in a centralized location – either built-in to TVs, or by adding affordable dongles or mini boxes, like the new-for-2024 Roku Ultra, to older televisions. (Look for an Engadget review of that model soon.) One big advantage of the Roku platform is that it's always getting free software updates to keep it current — like the cool new feature that turns your TV into a sort of virtual art museum by displaying famous paintings as a screensaver. However, Roku is less adept when it comes to solving one common frustration of the streaming age: The inability to access popular shows, movies and sporting events because of geographic restrictions.
Using a VPN is a common way to tackle this issue, but unlike Fire TV, Apple TV and other rivals, Roku systems don’t have native VPN support. But that’s not the end of the story: You can still use a VPN to access a wider range of programming via a Roku — you just need to use a workaround. We’ll show you how.
The benefits of using a VPN
When it comes to streaming, a VPN has one main benefit: changing your IP address — the unique number that identifies the general location of the device and network you're using to access the web. A VPN tunnels your connection through its servers to obfuscate your IP, making it seem like you’re watching from elsewhere. As a result, a service like Netflix will see your location as, say, the United Kingdom versus the US. You’ll then have access to a different set of programming. For example, you need Max to stream Friends, The Big Bang Theory or Rick and Morty in the US, but they're all available on Netflix in the UK.
VPNs have several other benefits related to privacy and security. VPN servers have military-grade AES 256-bit encryption, meaning they’re more secure than connecting to the Internet normally. So, since you’re browsing the Internet by tunneling through the VPN, your Internet service provider can’t see all of your browsing destinations (and sell your viewing habits to data brokers).
The easiest way to use a VPN on Roku
Although Roku doesn’t natively support VPNs, there are a few workarounds. You can, for instance, set up a VPN on your home’s router. That allows you to protect the whole network and every device that connects to it, keeping everyone in your household anonymous online. But it can also cause confusion when you want to access local services — and it requires a very high-level of technical knowledge, and only works with certain routers.
Instead, we recommend a far easier method: connecting a VPN to your Roku via AirPlay or screencast. To do this, subscribe to a VPN and install it on your smartphone or laptop. Then, stream content on that device and AirPlay or screencast it to your Roku TV. The icon to do this should look like a TV with Wi-Fi rays.
Engadget
We prefer this method because it’s simpler overall. You can access any geo-blocked content on your smartphone or laptop first and then cast it on your smart TV.
You can make sure your Roku model is AirPlay-compatible by checking this resource on Roku’s site. If it isn’t, you can always just directly patch your phone or laptop to the TV using an HDMI cable or an appropriate dongle.
Choosing the best VPN
While you'll be using a phone or laptop as the ultimate source for your VPN-routed streams, that actually gives you a wider list of services from which to choose. Although each VPN has the same basic functionalities, their price and extra features vary. Before deciding which one is right for your needs and the devices you have, take some time to look at what each one offers and see what other users have to say. Start by checking out our list of best VPNs — and happy streaming.
VPN options for other streaming platforms
Don't have a Roku? Good news: Robust VPN options (or alternatives) exist for the other major streaming platforms, too.

The Morning After: Apple’s surprise iPad mini,"Apple just announced the seventh-gen iPad mini, three years after its sixth-gen model. It has a faster A17 Pro chip, originally found in the iPhone 15 Pro, which means it’ll be able to handle Apple’s incoming AI features — although it’s not Apple&#39;s most powerful mobile chip. There’s more RAM too.
Power aside, it has the same 8.3-inch screen as the previous model and an identical 2,266 x 1,488 resolution at 326 ppi. The refresh rate remains a modest 60Hz, in an era of 90Hz or higher. It’s not any bigger, wider or slimmer than its predecessor either.
It’s been a while since a new iPad mini, so we were overdue an update. However, this is a very mild update with no design changes. Also, while the size is smaller, no M-series chip. The new iPad mini arrives on October 23, starting at $499 for 128GB storage. It’ll arrive in blue, purple, starlight and space gray colors.

Sonos’ $999 Arc Ultra is a powerhouse soundbar in a (relatively) small package
With the company’s new Sound Motion technology.
Sonos
Don’t mention the disastrous app. Sonos announced the Arc Ultra and Sub 4, with the former replacing the $899 Arc as the company’s flagship home theater product.​​ It’s the first Sonos soundbar to include its new Sound Motion technology, which apparently results in a much smaller product. The Arc Ultra can produce up to twice as much bass as its predecessor, according to Sonos. The new Sub 4 ($799) features more processing power, additional RAM, and a new Wi-Fi radio for improved connectivity. It’s also more efficient, with the company claiming an almost 50 percent reduction in idle power consumption. Both will go on sale October 29, so you can upgrade your sound system just before a Halloween movie marathon, I guess.

The best fitness trackers for 2024,"Fitness trackers are a solid option if you really want to hone in on tracking, well, your fitness. Some of the best fitness trackers also include additional sensors to track things like stress, sleep and other health metrics. Sure, you could opt for the best smartwatch, but if you’re not interested in all of the extra features they offer, a fitness tracker might be a better (and more affordable) option. Accurate workout and activity tracking is what fitness trackers do best; most include a pedometer to track your steps throughout the day. They might not look as glamorous as an Apple Watch, but they do a particular job well. We’ve researched and tested a good selection of the most popular fitness trackers out there to help make your decision a little easier. 
What do fitness trackers do best? 
The answer seems simple: Fitness trackers are best at monitoring exercise, be it a 10-minute walk around the block or that half marathon you’ve been diligently training for. Obviously, smartwatches can help you reach your fitness goals too, but there are some areas where fitness bands have proven to be the best buy: focus, design, battery life, durability and price.  
When I say “focus,” I’m alluding to the fact that fitness trackers are made to track activity well; anything else is extra. They often don’t have the bells and whistles that smartwatches do, which could distract from their health tracking abilities. They also tend to have fewer sensors and internal components, which keeps them smaller and lighter. Fitness trackers are also a better option for those who just want a less conspicuous device on their wrists all day. 
Battery life tends to be better on fitness trackers, too. While most smartwatches last one to two days on a single charge, fitness bands offer between five and seven days of battery life — and that’s with all-day and all-night use even with sleep tracking features enabled 
When it comes to price point, there’s no competition. Most worthwhile smartwatches start at $175 to $200, but you can get a solid fitness tracker starting at $70. Yes, more expensive bands exist (and we recommend a few here), but you’ll find more options under $150 in the fitness tracker space than in the smartwatch space. 
When to get a smartwatch instead 
If you need a bit more from your wearable and don’t want to be limited to a fitness or activity tracker, a smartwatch may be the best buy for you. There are things like on-watch apps, alerts and even more robust fitness features that smartwatches have and the best fitness trackers don’t. You can use one to control smart home appliances, set timers and reminders, check weather reports and more. Some smartwatches let you choose which apps you want to receive alerts from, and the options go beyond just call and text notifications. Just make sure your smartwatch is compatible with your Android or iPhone, however, before purchasing, as not all of them work with both operating systems. 
But the extra fitness features are arguably the most important thing to think about when deciding between a fitness tracker and a smartwatch. The latter devices tend to be larger, giving them more space for things like GPS, barometers, onboard music storage and more. While you can find built-in GPS on select fitness trackers, it’s not common.

Other fitness trackers we've tested 
Fitbit Inspire 3 
The Fitbit Inspire 3 strips out all the luxury features from the Charge 6 and keeps only the essential tracking features. You won’t get built-in GPS tracking or Fitbit Pay or Spotify control but you do get solid activity tracking, automatic workout detection, smartphone alerts and plenty more. The updated version has a sleeker design and includes a color touch display and connected GPS, the latter of which lets you track pace and distance while you run or bike outside while you have your phone with you. When compared to the Charge 6, the Inspire 3 is more fashionable, too. Its interchangeable bands let you switch up the look and feel of your tracker whenever you want, and it’s slim enough to blend in with other jewelry you might be wearing. We were also impressed by its multi-day battery life: Fitbit promises up to 10 days on a single charge, and that checked out for us. After four days of round-the-clock use, the Inspire 3 still had 66 percent battery left to go. 
Fitness tracker FAQs 
How long do fitness tracker batteries last? 
The battery life of fitness trackers can vary depending on the model and its features. On average, most fitness trackers last between five to seven days on a single charge. Basic models with limited features could stretch up to 10 days or more. However, more advanced trackers with features like continuous heart rate monitoring, GPS, or always-on displays may need recharging after one to three days. If you're using GPS or streaming music through your fitness tracker, you'll find that this drains the battery faster. By using these features less, or turning them off, you'll extend battery life.&nbsp;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-fitness-trackers-133053484.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-fitness-trackers-133053484.html?src=rss,"Wed, 16 Oct 2024 09:00:38 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
The next entry-level Kindle leaked on a UK store,"John Lewis, a high-end department store chain in the UK, briefly listed a new Kindle that&#39;s not available from anybody else. It&#39;s the upcoming 12th-generation Kindle ereader that Amazon has yet to announce, though its information has leaked quite a few times before Lewis prematurely posted a listing for it. While that listing is no longer live, Good Ereader and The Verge were able to take screenshots and take note of the device&#39;s specs. Amazon called the 12th-gen basic Kindle the &quot;lightest and most compact&quot; one it has ever designed, with a 6-inch 300 ppi display and 16GB of storage, in the retailer&#39;s description.
Its front light is 25 percent brighter at max setting than previous versions, and it has a higher contrast ratio, but you still won&#39;t be able to turn the light cooler or warmer like you could on more expensive Kindles. The device will enable faster page turns than previous Kindles, though, and has a new dark mode feature that inverts the e-ink display&#39;s colors, according to The Verge. If you prefer listening to your books, you can fire up Audible on the new Kindle and connect your headphones or speakers to it via Bluetooth, as well.&nbsp;
In addition to the basic 12th-gen Kindle, John Lewis also posted the listing for its Kids Edition version. It&#39;s the same device, except it ships with a colorful case and comes with a free six-month subscription to Amazon Kids+. Previous Kids Edition Kindles came with a year-long free membership to the subscription service, but for this one, you&#39;d have to pay $6 a month for continued access to curated books, videos and games for children after half a year. As for the 12th-gen Kindle itself, the John Lewis listing said it will set you back £95 ($124) or around £10 more than the previous version. Meanwhile, the Kids Edition will cost you a bit more, as the retailer listed it for £115 ($150).This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/the-next-entry-level-kindle-leaked-on-a-uk-store-035240220.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/general/the-next-entry-level-kindle-leaked-on-a-uk-store-035240220.html?src=rss,"Wed, 16 Oct 2024 03:52:40 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
The latest Freewrite device is a fancy mechanical keyboard built with writers in mind,"The Detroit-based company Astrohaus has been making its “distraction-free writing tools” under the Freewrite name for about a decade. So far, those have all been standalone, single-purpose devices meant simply for drafting text, but Astrohaus is branching out at CES 2025. The company just announced a mechanical keyboard called the Freewrite Wordrunner, a device designed specifically with writers in mind.
This comes more than three years after Astrohaus quietly revealed intentions to build a keyboard, originally known as the Maestro. But the company eventually pulled the plug on its planned 2022 launch, and I hadn’t heard anything about it since then — it seems that they’ve just been working away at it this whole time. CEO Adam Leeb said in a press release that the company had been iterating and developing it for almost four years.
Freewrite
Mechanical keyboards have largely become the domain of gamers; the company wanted to build a device for people who make their living writing instead. Without spending some quality time with it, I can’t say if they’ve hit that mark yet, but there are some fun ideas on display here.
The Wordrunner has a tenkeyless design that looks familiar at first glance, but you’ll quickly notice that the function row has been replaced by a custom set of keys that’ll make zipping around text documents faster. That includes find and replace, undo and redo, paragraph up and down as well as back, forward and reload keys. I’d be upset about losing media controls from the function row, but the Wordrunner has it covered with the bright red joystick / button. It moves in all four cardinal directions, can be turned like a knob and can also be pressed in vertically to skip tracks, change volume or pause your tunes.

On the other side, you’ll find three customizable macro keys with the cutesy names “zap,” “pow” and “bam.” They’re programmable for anything you might want, but Astrohaus suggested using them to launch specific writing apps, converting text to title case or inserting the date. I don’t yet know what I’d use them for, but having customizable keys is a table-stakes feature for most enthusiast keyboards so I’m glad to see them here.
Probably the most visually striking thing about the Wordrunner are the two mechanical counters you’ll see up top. One is a timer you can use for writing sprints or just staying focused for a bit. More intriguing is the Wordometer dead-center at the top of the keyboard. It’ll track your words with its whopping eight-digit mechanical counter, and since it saves your word count as long as you want, you could try and max it out someday. Of course, you can also reset it at any time or pause it if you don’t want it to advance while you’re chatting with friends or sending emails.

The mechanical keys are backlit and use Kailh switches; the keycaps are replaceable but the switches aren't. It also has some sound dampening built in so you can use it without subjecting everyone around to you overly loud key clacks (this may be a plus or minus depending on how you like your keyboards). As for connectivity, the Wordrunner uses Bluetooth or USB-C, and you can pair the keyboard with three different devices and quickly switch between them with dedicated hotkeys.
I got a chance to play with a prototype of the Wordrunner, and my first impressions was ""wow, this is heavy!"" It's a thick slab of polished aluminum that matches the finish of the premium Hemingway edition of the Smart Typewriter. Astrohaus founder / CEO Adam Leeb told me that the company was shooting to make this keyboard feel like a premium, limited edition with the finish even if they're planning for it to be part of the permanent portfolio.
Nathan Ingraham for Engadget
While I didn't get to try the Wordrunner hooked up to a computer, I still got to see the mechanical Wordometer turn over when I started typing. It's quite satisfying to see it count up as I wrote an imaginary story on it, and there's a small LED that's green when the counter is turned on and red when you turn it off. The keys and travel all felt great, and the joystick was similarly a lovely tactile experience — I'm looking forward to using it like a volume knob for media. Leeb says that this keyboard is still a prototype, but it feels quite polished and nearly final to me.&nbsp;
Finally, there’s the ever-present question of availability. Astrohaus is launching the Wordrunner on Kickstarter, as it has done with most of its other hardware over the last 10 years. The campaign should start in February with early bird pricing, but we don’t know what that price will be yet. Fortunately, there’s a pretty low-commitment way to get the best price if you’re curious. Astrohaus says you can place a $1 reservation for priority access and the best possible pricing, with plans to deliver the first batch of keyboards before the end of the year. That’s a long ways out, but a buck isn’t a bad investment if you’re interested.

Faraday Future pitches a ‘fresh start’ with a minivan prototype at CES 2025,"At CES 2017, Faraday Future introduced its futuristic luxury EV, the FF 91. Seven years later, following repeated delays, bankruptcy, lawsuits and other controversies, the company has sold “15 or 16” FF 91s. Now the company is detailing its latest strategy shift, with a plan to sell cheap EVs under its new low-cost “FX” brand. FX CEO Max Ma came to CES, along with two prototype vehicles, to pitch the plan that he described as a “fresh start” for the embattled company.
As you might expect with Faraday, the exact details are somewhat hazy, but it involves sourcing parts from Chinese car-makers and bringing them to the US to produce “mass volume mainstream vehicles” with some of the premium touches Faraday is known for. “We want to take that $300,000-car expertise from a technology and features and performance [standpoint] into a $30,000, $40,000 car to try to upgrade the overall user experience,” Ma said during a briefing with Engadget. The first FX vehicle, the flagship product of the brand’s lineup, will be a minivan (or, as Ma referred to it, “an AI MPV"") called the ""Super One.""
Faraday showed off two prototype minivans to demonstrate the concept. We were not permitted to take photos but the vehicles in the photo at the top of this post are the ones I saw.
One was meant to show the kind of premium in-cabin experience Faraday is envisioning for the low-cost car. It had two rows of white leather captain seats. The second-row seats had reclining footrests, heated seats and built-in massagers. There was also a small fridge underneath the center console for keeping drinks cold. The vehicle was missing its door handles and several other pieces. “Obviously, we’ll have door handles,” a Faraday rep assured us.
The second minivan was even less finished. The entire interior, including the dashboard and instrument cluster, was covered in black fabric held together with binder clips. But a Faraday rep took me and other reporters for a ride in it, driving in small, slow circles around a Las Vegas parking lot. Later, Faraday offered to let me take the minivan for a spin and I — apparently the “first lady” to pilot the vehicle — also drove it in slow circles around the parking lot. I’m not sure what I was supposed to get out of it, though, it felt like driving a minivan.
There are two other vehicles planned for the initial FX lineup, the FX 5 and FX 6, which were previously announced by the company. Faraday is aiming for a $20,000 - $30,000 price for the FX 5 and $30,000 - $50,000 for the FX 6. There aren't many other details yet about either, though Faraday shared a teaser image of an FX 6 prototype, which it described as an ""extra-large luxury AIEV.""
Faraday Future
Faraday claims it will start producing one of its planned vehicles later this year, with the first ""pre-production"" model rolling off the production line by the end of 2025, according to a timeline shared by Ma. That’s a lofty promise considering the company’s past history of mismanagement and delays. Faraday Future CEO Matthias Aydt also acknowledged that the company has yet to finalize its partnerships with the companies that will supply its parts. He also didn’t address how tariffs may affect those plans.
Ma said he understood the skepticism. “Basically, this is a kind of fresh start. We really want to demonstrate that through our dedication of hard work, we can achieve what we promised.”This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/faraday-future-pitches-a-fresh-start-with-a-minivan-prototype-at-ces-2025-010050459.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/faraday-future-pitches-a-fresh-start-with-a-minivan-prototype-at-ces-2025-010050459.html?src=rss,"Thu, 09 Jan 2025 01:14:20 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
Motorbunny’s PlayMate lets your console (kinda) control your vibe,"The following article discusses adult themes.
There was a legend in my high school about turning your PlayStation 2 into an ersatz vibrator by creating a custom skate park in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3. Build a circular grind rail, turn off the ability to fall, jump on it and your DualShock would launch into a never ending frenzy of haptic feedback. It’s an idea the team at Motorbunny is taking to its logical conclusion, adding a wireless controller for its eponymous ride on sex toy that can connect to a DualSense controller. Its pitch is that you’ll be able to combine getting your game on with getting off. And yes, I am ashamed for writing that sentence.
The company was at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada, showing off PlayMate, its wireless dongle that can control the beefy saddle-style toy. In its demo, the PlayMate was plugged into the USB-C port on the back of a DualSense controlling a PS5 playing Rocket League. Except there’s no way to pull the haptics data from the DualSense, or any other gaming handset, for that matter. Instead, it has a built-in gyroscope that will track how aggressively you pitch and tilt your controller, and uses that information to control the Motorbunny. This isn’t as good as the Tony Hawk plan from 2001, but will at least enable some folks to merge both of their hobbies at the same time.
PlayMate is one of a suite of products the company is releasing, including a series of less expensive vibes under the Fluffer label. This is a sub-brand designed to tie in the worlds of gaming and sex, with the app even having some arcade games that you can use to control your toys. In one demo, there was a Flappy Bird clone that would increase the intensity of the vibration the longer you were able to keep the bird in the air. Sadly the company wasn’t ready to share details of pricing and availability just yet, but said a whole host of products would be hitting the market in the following months.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/motorbunnys-playmate-lets-your-console-kinda-control-your-vibe-233001475.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/motorbunnys-playmate-lets-your-console-kinda-control-your-vibe-233001475.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 23:30:01 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
Threads and Instagram will recommend political content after all,"Meta is continuing to overhaul its moderation and content rules. Instagram head Adam Mosseri posted today that Instagram and Threads will start including political content in recommendations. It's a reversal from the policy the two platforms adopted last year, which made political content something users had to choose if they wanted to see. Now, Mosseri said that there will be three levels of political content that Instagram and Threads users can pick to see: less, standard (which will be the default) and more.
""It’s proven impractical to draw a red line around what is and is not political content,"" Mosseri wrote. The change will begin rolling out this week in the US and in the rest of the world over the coming weeks.
 
This announcement is the latest in a series of shifts Meta is making that seem like efforts to curry favor with President-elect Donald Trump. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that the company would eliminate third-party fact-checkers in favor of a Community Notes model for Facebook, Instagram and Threads, mimicking the approach taken at X (formerly Twitter). Nick Clegg stepped down as Meta's president of global affairs to be replaced by Joel Kaplan, who is well-connected to Republicans in Washington DC.
Yesterday, Instagram was also discovered to have blocked several LGBTQ hashtags and treated them as ""sexually suggestive material"" for months. The company said this was an error.&nbsp;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-and-instagram-will-recommend-political-content-after-all-232343107.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-and-instagram-will-recommend-political-content-after-all-232343107.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 23:23:44 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
A holographic windshield from Hyundai Mobis is a big upgrade for in-car HUDs at CES 2025,"Automotive heads up displays (HUDs) have been around as far back as 1988, and while they’ve gotten brighter and more colorful over the years, even today’s most sophisticated implementations still feel a bit primitive. But after seeing what Hyundai Mobis (which makes auto parts for Hyundai, Kia and Genesis) is calling the world’s first full-windshield holographic display at CES 2025, it felt like I was looking at a major evolution in-car infotainment.
Unlike traditional reflective HUDs, Hyundai Mobis’ holographic windshield display (HWD) consists of two main components: a projector (or in this case multiple projectors) hidden beneath the dash and a special optical film with a carefully tuned wavelength sensitivity embedded inside the windshield itself. This combination allows the HWD to pump out brighter and more colorful images with much shallower viewing angles. Unless you’re sitting in the right spot, you may not even see the HUD at all.
Because of the HWD&#39;s narrow viewing angles, Hyundai Mobis set up a separate demo to better show what it looks like. When installed in a car, the HWD&#39;s small sweet spot means the passenger&#39;s displays is not visible from the driver&#39;s side and vice versa, which is good for eliminating distractions. Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget
On the Hyundai Mobis Kia EV9 demo vehicle, the HWD isn’t limited to just a small corner at the bottom of the windshield. Instead, it’s split up into three different zones that span the entire width of the car: two for the driver and one dedicated to the passenger. For the driver, the HWD can display basic stuff like the car’s speed, directions and more. But where things get interesting is when it shows holographic 3D maps that can adjust in real-time based on your position, adding an entirely new dimension to help you reach your destination.
For passengers, their dedicated section of the HWD can be used independently for checking vehicle information or simply watching a video or playing games. Critically, because of the limited viewing angles of Hyundai Mobis’ tech, the driver can’t see the passenger’s side of the HWD, so there’s no distraction risk. The whole system is rather impressive, because so much of the tech is hidden beneath the dashboard. The only evidence that this HWD is different from more traditional implementations is that if you look really closely at the windshield when it’s off, you can see a faint outline where the optical film is sandwiched between the glass.
After checking out Hyundai Mobis’ demo, I also got a chance to talk to one of the engineers behind the HWD, Dr. Minho Shin, who added additional context and insight about the tech. Through a translator, Dr. Shin told me that the company envisions its HWD as a way to augment the main display found in most modern cars, which will most likely serve as the main control center for manipulating what you see on the windshield. And for passengers, it’s possible they will be able to control what they see on their side of the HWD simply by casting content from their phones. Furthermore, the placement and size of the holographic display makes it easier for the driver to see and interact with helpful tools like real-time 3D maps compared to current tech. Dr. Shin even said that it’s possible to create a version of the HWD that would cover both the entire width and vertical height of the windshield, which seems like something straight out of every sci-fi or cyberpunk movie ever made. However, due to laws in many countries, that kind of functionality isn’t widely permitted.

Now it must be mentioned that at CES 2025, BMW demoed similar technology with its Panoramic iDrive system. The Bavarian automaker’s approach is arguably a bit further along, at least when it comes to being integrated into its existing infotainment system and its availability, which is slated to arrive on all new models by the end of 2025. However, when you look closer, it almost seems like BMW is cheating a bit by using a black film that goes along the bottom of the windshield instead of being completely transparent like with the HWD, which may give Hyundai Mobi’s tech significantly improved driver visibility and awareness.
While BMW’s panoramic HUD is slated to arrive first, Hyundai Mobis won’t be far behind as the company hopes to put its HWD into production by sometime in 2027.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/a-holographic-windshield-from-hyundai-mobis-is-a-big-upgrade-for-in-car-huds-at-ces-2025-230050196.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/transportation/a-holographic-windshield-from-hyundai-mobis-is-a-big-upgrade-for-in-car-huds-at-ces-2025-230050196.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 23:00:50 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
CES 2025: LG's Swiss-army-knife projector hides in plain sight,"Companies have been smashing together multiple gadgets into one product for a long time, and there are plenty of examples at CES 2025. However, LG&#39;s latest projector, the PF600U, which is a mash up of a projector, a lamp and a Bluetooth speaker may be one of the few compelling examples of the genre. If nothing else, the device could allow you to hide your A/V gear in plain sight within a floor lamp when you&#39;re not using it. LG intends for it to be tucked away in a living space, at the end of couch or behind an end table for example.
The PF600U isn&#39;t a great name, so I hope LG comes up with something better before this thing goes on sale. As a projector, the PF600U offers an LED FHD (1,920 x 1,080) image and 300 ANSI lumens of brightness. It doesn&#39;t produce the crispest views, but you can beam a picture up to 120 inches with it. I thought the results in LG&#39;s booth were perfectly useable for casual TV and movie watching, especially in a small apartment where space is at a premium.&nbsp;
I didn&#39;t get a chance to hear the PF600U&#39;s sound quality, but LG says the device has passive radiator speakers embedded inside. Like the picture quality, it&#39;s probably enough for low-key TV and music audio, but purists will certainly want something more robust. Again, it seems like the idea is saving space over producing pristine sound quality, so this was never for them anyway.
When it comes to the lamp features, there are nine dimmable color LEDs to set the mood. The top, where all of the tech resides, tilts so the ring or lights on the bottom can be projected on a wall or other surface. And as you might expect, the whole thing is controlled by webOS. Plus, there are buttons for positioning, changing modes, power and more on the top panel, encircled by the speaker&#39;s grille.&nbsp;
LG hasn&#39;t announced pricing or availability for the PF600U yet. Those details will likely come closer to launch day.&nbsp;

PUBG will get AI-powered NPCs,"PUBG: Battlegrounds will add non-player characters powered by NVIDIA ACE generative AI. These PUBG Allies are being dubbed Co-Playable Characters, and they can have real-time conversations with a player about what&#39;s happening in a match. They can also adapt their strategies and gameplay to work with the player&#39;s style. Krafton, the battle royale&#39;s publisher, demoed this technology at CES 2025.
&quot;We will continue to innovate user experiences by integrating CPC into our games and aim to establish it as a benchmark for the gaming industry,&quot; said Kangwook Lee, head of Krafton&#39;s deep learning division. Krafton will also publish upcoming life simulator inZOI, and had a CES demo of a CPC in that game as well.
NVIDIA introduced its generative AI tech, the Avatar Cloud Engine, during a keynote at Computex 2023. The ACE generative AI is also present in the multiplayer title Mecha BREAK, which appeared at Gamescom last year. The Krafton games are using on-device small language models built with NVIDIA ACE. The publisher did not specify in its press release when it will start rolling out CPCs.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pubg-will-get-ai-powered-npcs-220218057.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pubg-will-get-ai-powered-npcs-220218057.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 22:02:18 +0000",Sports,www.engadget.com
AMD VP explains why the Ryzen AI Max likely wouldn't exist without Apple,"AMD&#39;s Ryzen AI Max chips came as a huge surprise at CES 2025. They&#39;re basically super-powered versions of the company&#39;s Ryzen AI hardware with up to 16 CPU cores and 50 RDNA 3.5 graphics cores, alongside a pool of as much as 128GB integrated RAM. AMD claims the Ryzen AI Max chips will deliver up to 2.6 times faster 3D rendering than Intel&#39;s Core Ultra 9 288V, as well as 1.4 times better graphics performance.
Squint a bit, and you might think AMD was taking a bit of inspiration from Apple Silicon, with its powerful CPU cores, graphics and unified memory. But according to VP Joe Macri, AMD was building towards this long before Apple. &quot;We were building APUs [chips combining CPUs and Radeon graphics] while Apple was using discrete GPUs. They were using our discrete GPUs. So I don&#39;t credit Apple with coming up with the idea.&quot; AMD also had experience stuffing gobs of memory into its Instinct data center GPUs.
Still, Macri gives Apple credit for proving that you don&#39;t need discrete graphics to sell people on powerful computers. &quot;Many people in the PC industry said, well, if you want graphics, it&#39;s gotta be discrete graphics because otherwise people will think it&#39;s bad graphics,&quot; he said. &quot;What Apple showed was consumers don&#39;t care what&#39;s inside the box. They actually care what the what the box looks like. They care about the screen, the keyboard, the mouse. They care about what it does.&quot;
With the success of Apple Silicon, Macri was finally able to get approval to spend a &quot;mind boggling&quot; amount of money developing the Ryzen AI Max. &quot;I always knew, because we were building APUs, and I&#39;d been pushing for this big APU forever, that I could build, a system that was smaller, faster, and I could give much higher performance at the same power,&quot; he said.
I briefly saw the Ryzen AI Max in action while testing the latest ASUS ROG Flow Z13 at AMD&#39;s CES booth. I was able to play Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart in 1080p at well above 60fps, with tons of graphical flourishes. It was tough to tell on such a small tablet screen, but the overall performance looked on par with a base PlayStation 5 (albeit at a slightly lower resolution). AMD claims the Ryzen AI Max is also comparable to Apple&#39;s 14-core M4 Pro chip (which it also beats out in the Vray benchmark).
Ryzen AI Max systems will roll out in the first and second quarter of the year, including the aforementioned ROG Flow Z13 as well as HP&#39;s ZBook Ultra G1a.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/amd-vp-explains-why-the-ryzen-ai-max-likely-wouldnt-exist-without-apple-220034111.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/computing/amd-vp-explains-why-the-ryzen-ai-max-likely-wouldnt-exist-without-apple-220034111.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 22:00:34 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
Shark joins the high-tech skincare mask war with an impressive CES 2025 opening shot,"I have to admit — I used to be very skeptical of LED devices that purport to be good for your skin. When they first started being sold for home use, I felt like they were mostly expensive, ineffective appliances that were obvious cash grabs. Nowadays, though, as is usually the case with any burgeoning category of products, the technology has improved. We're seeing more sophisticated offerings that not only use better components, but are more comfortable to wear. Full face masks from the likes of Therabody, Dr. Dennis Gross and Omnilux have exploded in popularity, taking over social media and constantly selling out. After hearing rave reviews from friends and family, and undergoing more light treatments in salons myself, I have grown more convinced there's room for devices like these.&nbsp;
Shark, the maker of vacuum cleaners, air fryers and assorted kitchen gear, has unveiled its take on the LED face mask device here at CES 2025. Launched under its three-year-old Shark Beauty arm, the new ""CryoGlow under-eye cooling + LED anti-aging and skin clearing face mask"" has quite a long name. I'm just going to refer to it as the CryoGlow mask from here on. At a meeting here in Las Vegas, Shark's senior vice president of global product development Danielle Lessing described a number of ways the CryoGlow is different from what's currently out there.
First of all, as its name implies, there is a cooling component to this device. In addition to the 160 ""interlocking tri-wick LEDs"" on the mask, there are two metallic plates on the cheeks that are shaped like eye masks. This is the conduit for what Shark is calling its ""InstaChill"" technology and basically are a pair of cold plates that, in my brief time with the CryoGlow, felt satisfyingly soothing. In fact, that might be my favorite part of the device (and frankly its differentiating trait).&nbsp;
After putting on the CryoGlow for maybe about a minute, and after I took several hilarious pictures and selfies with it, I really appreciated how cold it felt in my under-eye area. To be clear, the plates felt chilly immediately after I wore the mask, but it was the prolonged coolness that I enjoyed. And after removing the device, I still relished the sensation that remained, even after a few minutes. I don't feel like I had the mask on for long enough to know if it'd start to feel clunky after prolonged wear, but at least during my demo, I didn't feel strained, nor did the wired remote control get in my way.
I also want to note that, unlike the Therabody option, Shark's CryoGlow does not vibrate. Lessing said ""This is a skincare system and vibrating doesn't affect the skin.""
Lessing stressed to me the importance of the tri-wick LED bulbs each being able to produce red, blue and deep infrared light, as they differ from some other products on the market that might only use single or dual-wick bulbs instead. In those cases, manufacturers may choose to lay red-only bulbs or blue-only bulbs in alternating layouts or various arrangements that allow them to claim to provide both types of light, while effectively covering less area per bulb.
Cherlynn Low for Engadget
It's this sort of math that Lessing enthusiastically highlighted in our quick meeting, as she told me that the company worked hard to calculate the ideal combination of factors like distance of the bulbs from the wearer's face and apart from each other. To that end, the CryoGlow will sit in a way that the LEDs are about 15mm from your skin — a good balance between effectiveness and coverage. The bulbs themselves are spaced 10mm apart, and the four programs that Shark offers also consider the duration of the lights on your face.&nbsp;
Lessing said the company wanted to make something that was more inclusive, not just of different head sizes and types, but also of skin concerns. Most of the products that are currently available tend to target signs of aging on women, she said. Shark wants to buck that trend, and part of that effort involves making a mask that should fit people of all types — from women with smaller faces to men with larger heads.&nbsp;
When I first laid eyes on the CryoGlow in person, I couldn't help but smile. Unlike the Theraface or Dr. Dennis Gross masks, which look a little robotic or cyborg-like, the Shark device is, strangely enough, cute? The shape of its mouth cutout is slightly upturned and the whole thing just looks like it's smiling at you. I also instinctively reached out to stroke the textured sides of the mask, which look like lines raked in sand. I could see making this my pet.&nbsp;
Cherlynn Low for Engadget
The CryoGlow not only looks adorable, but also felt comfortable to wear. It was big enough for my larger-than-average head, but didn't feel too heavy. That might be thanks to the adjustable T-shaped head strap that reminds me of the Apple Vision Pro. Lessing said the team also drew inspiration from ski goggles for the design, especially for the protective guards around the eye cutouts.&nbsp;
There's also the fact that the CryoGlow is fairly lightweight, likely due to the fact that it's powered by a battery in the attached remote control. This handheld controller is connected via a cord, which is a slightly less elegant approach than competing products that have on-mask buttons. But I do appreciate that it looks and feels like a Nokia 3310 with a much nicer screen and a dial plus two buttons below it.&nbsp;
You can rotate the wheel to scroll through the menu, and I liked the aesthetic Shark used for the interface, too. The system offers four treatment modes: an under-eye ""revive"" that delivers ""cryo-inspired tightening and soothing,"" a 6-minute ""Better aging"" option, an 8-minute ""Skin Clearing Treatment"" that targets acne and a 4-minute ""Skin Sustain"" maintenance mode that's meant for daily use. There are also three chill levels available, which you can control with this system. Shark says its tests indicated clearer skin can be observed in four weeks of use, while two months of consistent application might result in firmer skin.
Shark
Shark says its programs are all backed by clinical testing, and most intriguingly, it actually put its CryoGlow device to the test against competitors. According to Shark, this image ""captures a demonstration conducted featuring light absorbing, photochromic paint to show the even coverage of CryoGlow’s iQLED technology vs. a competitor’s uneven coverage."" I will point out that while it does seem like Shark's device had a more even and generally larger spread, it does leave the two patches below the eye bare.
It's unclear what this competing device is or how much it might cost, but considering the CryoGlow is priced at $349 while the Theraface Mask and the Dr. Dennis Gross SpectraLite FaceWare Pro start at $599 and $455 respectively, I'm already intrigued. This feels like a sophisticated device that's at least within the range I might be able to afford. And I loved my brief experience with it, too. I will likely have to test other competing products before I can definitively evaluate how well the CryoGlow fares against what's out there, but for now, and for the price, I'm very impressed by Shark's LED mask debut.&nbsp;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/shark-joins-the-high-tech-skincare-mask-war-with-an-impressive-ces-2025-opening-shot-214804543.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/wearables/shark-joins-the-high-tech-skincare-mask-war-with-an-impressive-ces-2025-opening-shot-214804543.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 21:48:04 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
Samsung The Frame Pro at CES 2025: A big upgrade for the art TV,"There's no denying the staying power of Samsung's The Frame. The company struck gold in 2017 when it debuted the TV that blends in with your home decor and shows art pieces when not in use. As popular as the model has become, it wasn't great for all of the other things you need a TV for — like watching shows and movies or gaming. Of course, there have been various imitators over the last five years too, including some of the competition here at CES 2025.&nbsp;
Samsung is hoping to win over even more customers with its newly announced The Frame Pro. This new model has two significant upgrades that should make it a much better TV and not just an alternative to the black rectangle that takes up space when you aren't using it. First, and perhaps most importantly, The Frame Pro now has a Neo QLED display — the same Mini LED tech that powers the company's high-end QN900 series TVs.
The Verge reports that Samsung's use of Mini LEDs on The Frame Pro doesn't work like it does on most TVs. Typically, there are dimming zones behind the display for precise control over which sections should be illuminated and which should be darker or black. Samsung didn't do that on this model, relying instead on a row of Mini LEDs along the bottom of The Frame Pro and promising a degree of local dimming.&nbsp;
Billy Steele for Engadget
At CES, Samsung's demos were focused on showing off art on The Frame Pro more than any content that would've confirmed if the approach to Mini LEDs hampered performance. But, in a side-by-side with a still image from a movie, The Frame Pro was brighter, with more detail and deeper blacks that the existing Frame. You can also tell a difference looking at the same art on the two TVs beside each other. Details like texture and strokes pop off the matte screen more on The Frame Pro, making the art TV even better at its primary function. Plus, Samsung says its boosted the refresh rate to 144Hz to improve the gaming experience, and the 2024 Frame also supports variable refresh rates for smoother gameplay. So, it stands to reason The Frame Pro would as well.
The second big upgrade on The Frame Pro is a new Wireless One Connect Box that's similar to what LG has been hyping for its M-series TVs for years now. Samsung's version is much smaller, looking more like a game console than a cube, and it relies on Wi-Fi (up to Wi-Fi 7) to wirelessly transmit content and audio from connected streaming gear and game consoles. The company says you can place it in a cabinet without interference and at distances up to 10 meters away.&nbsp;
The Wireless One Connect Box will replace the larger One Connect Box that still required a single cord running to The Frame. This should offer more versatility to where customers place the TV, since it doesn't have to be physically connected to a box to receive signal from HDMI inputs.
The Frame Pro should be a big upgrade to The Frame given the Neo QLED panel, but we'll have to wait and see if that holds true in ""regular"" TV use. And of course, it will be more expensive than the current Frame that starts at $600 for the 32-inch size (final pricing is still TBD).This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-the-frame-pro-at-ces-2025-a-big-upgrade-for-the-art-tv-214300273.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-the-frame-pro-at-ces-2025-a-big-upgrade-for-the-art-tv-214300273.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 21:24:58 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
Sam Altman's sister is suing the OpenAI CEO alleging sexual abuse,"Annie Altman, the sister of OpenAI founder and CEO Sam Altman, has sued her brother accusing him of sexually assaulting her when she was a minor. In a complaint filed this week with a Missouri federal court, Annie Altman alleges her older brother committed “numerous acts of rape, sexual assault, sexual abuse, molestation, sodomy, and battery” from 1997 to 2006, with the abuse starting when she was only three years old.
In a joint statement he made alongside his mother and two younger brothers, Sam Altman said “all of [Annie’s] claims are utterly untrue.” The Altmans say they’ve tried to support Annie in “many ways” over the years, including by offering direct financial assistance.
My sister has filed a lawsuit against me. Here is a statement from my mom, brothers, and me: pic.twitter.com/Nve0yokTSX— Sam Altman (@sama) January 7, 2025
 
“Annie has made deeply hurtful and entirely untrue claims about our family, especially Sam. We’ve chosen not to respond publicly, out of respect for her privacy and our own. However, she has now taken legal actions against Sam, and we feel we have no choice but to address this,” the statement reads. “… This situation causes immense pain to our entire family.”
Over the past few years, Annie Altman has made similar allegations online. “I’m not four years old with a 13 year old ‘brother’ climbing into my bed non-consensually anymore,” she wrote in a X post from March 2023.&nbsp;
As part of her lawsuit, Altman seeks a jury trial and damages in excess of $75,000. Per The New York Times, $75,000 is the minimum required for a federal lawsuit of this type. Her lawyer told The Times she is also seeking punitive damages based on her brother’s net worth, which could become public knowledge as part of the case’s discovery process.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/sam-altmans-sister-is-suing-the-openai-ceo-alleging-sexual-abuse-205745209.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/ai/sam-altmans-sister-is-suing-the-openai-ceo-alleging-sexual-abuse-205745209.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 20:57:46 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
All the laptops that piqued our interest at CES 2025,"CES is filled with wild and wacky curios, to be sure, but there are also plenty of good old-fashioned laptops. Every year the big chipmakers announce new products and the big computer manufacturers unveil new laptops that take advantage of updated CPUs and GPUs. All told, companies announced nearly two dozen upcoming laptops at this year's conference. Some are bulky beasts made for gaming, while others are thin beauties intended for portability. The vast majority of them are filled to the brim with the AI tools that everyone loves so very much. 
Here are all of the laptops that piqued our interest at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, just in case you need to start saving some money for a purchase later this year. 
ASUS Zenbook A14 
 
 
The ASUS Zenbook A14 is the MacBook Air competitor of our dreams. It weighs less than 2.2 pounds, which is actually a half a pound lighter than the Air. When it comes to specs, it actually outclasses Apple in nearly every category. There’s a 14-inch OLED screen, up to 32 hours (!) of battery life and up to 32GB of RAM. It’s also covered in a nifty ceramic coating that feels great to hold. 
It comes in two versions. There’s one that includes a Snapdragon X Plus CPU and 16GB of RAM, which starts at $900. The higher-end model features a Snapdragon X Elite chip and 32GB of RAM, starting at $1,100. The laptops will be available on January 13. 
  
 
Lenovo Thinkbook Plus Gen6 
 
 
Just because laptops have been around for decades doesn’t mean that companies can’t get a bit weird with them. Case in point? The Lenovo Thinkbook Plus Gen6. This is a laptop with a rollable screen that expands and contracts with the push of a button. Lenovo first introduced this as a concept device, but now it’s a real upcoming product. 
The 14-inch OLED display instantly transforms to a 16.7-inch panel, which effectively adds an extra 50 percent of screen real estate. The brightness is adequate, at 400 nits, and the performance looks solid. It comes with Intel’s Core Ultra 7 CPU, up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD storage. It’s also weirdly light, given the tech, at 3.6 pounds. We don’t have official pricing or availability yet, but it’s expected to cost somewhere around $3,500 and should hit store shelves this spring. 
Lenovo ThinkPad X9 
 
 
We called the Lenovo ThinkPad X9 “the least ThinkPad ever” for good reason. This new iteration ditched the long-standing carbon fiber frames and Trackpoint nubs found with classic models in favor of a more minimalist approach. It’s available in 14-inch and 15-inch versions, and both of these feature OLED displays. These laptops are powered by the Intel Core Ultra 7 processors, which means that you can’t upgrade the RAM because it’s soldered on. However, the SSD and battery are easily replaceable. Both models should be available in February, with a starting price of $1,400 for the 14-inch model and $1,550 for the 15-inch version. 
  
MSI Titan 18 HX Dragon Edition 
 
 
 
  Engadget
 
 
The MSI Titan 18 HX Dragon Edition adds some seriously-cool aesthetics to the most powerful laptop the company makes. There are a ton of unique design traits here, including a hand-drawn dragon on the lid that was acid-etched into the aluminum. As for specs, this laptop includes top-of-the-line components including next-gen Intel HX processors, NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPUs, PCIe Gen 5 SSD storage and Wi-Fi 7. There’s a massive 18-inch mini LED display and low-profile Cherry MX switches on the keyboard. MSI has yet to reveal pricing or availability on this one. 
Razer Blade 16 
 
 
 
  Razer
 
 
The Razer Blade 16 laptop is extraordinarily thin, at 0.59 inches. That makes it 32 percent slimmer than the 2024 model. There’s a 16-inch QHD display with a 240Hz refresh rate and a response time of 0.2ms. The computer also includes the AMD Ryzen 9 AI HX 370 processor and one of the brand-new NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50-series GPUs. There isn’t a release date yet, other than soon, nor is there a launch price. Last year’s model started at $2,700, so we can expect something in the same range. 
Samsung Galaxy Book5 Pro 
 
 
 
  Samsung 
 
 
Samsung unveiled an updated line of Galaxy Book laptops at CES. There’s the Galaxy Book5 Pro, which is available in 14-inch and 16-inch screen options, along with the Book5 360 with a 15-inch display. All of these computers are equipped with Intel’s newest Arrow Lake Core Ultra processors and have been built for AI tasks. To that end, Samsung has touted a long list of on-device AI circles, like its own version of Google’s Circle to Search. These laptops also include on-device photo upscaling and more. 
The Book5 Pro is a standard laptop, while the Book5 360 is a 2-in-one with a 15-6-inch AMOLED touch display. There’s no pricing yet on any of these models, but the company has said they’ll be available for purchase in February. 
ASUS Vivobook 14 and 16 
 
 
 
  ASUS
 
 
Just like the ultralight Zenbook A14, the refreshed Vivobook 14 and 16 laptops ship with a Qualcomm Snapdragon X chip. These are mid-grade computers that offer up 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The company says that the internals have been updated to allow for 44 percent more performance than the last-gen models. The battery also got an upgrade and now will last nearly 20 hours per charge. 
Both computers make use of the company’s not-at-all creepy “AI camera” which detects whether you’re sitting in front of the screen or not. The ASUS Vivobook 14 and Vivobook 16 are available to pre-order now for $700 and $750, respectively. 
  
Lenovo 10th-gen Legion Pro 7i 
 
 
 
  Lenovo
 
 
The tenth-generation Legion Pro 7i is a serious upgrade over its predecessors and should be a great option for gaming on-the-go. It supports up to an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 GPU, with an updated cooling system that enables 250W thermal design power. The laptop also supports up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor. On top of that, you can add up to 64GB of RAM. There’s a 16-inch OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate and a 1ms response time. 
It’s a beefy machine, however, coming at six pounds. The Legion Pro 7i will be available sometime in March, with a starting price of $2,400. 
  
Alienware Area 51 
 
 
 
  Sam Rutherford/Engadget
 
 
It’s been years, but Alienware’s Area 51 branding is back in a big way. The Alienware Area 51 laptops are the company’s latest flagship gaming devices. They are available in two display sizes, 16- and 18-inches, and support up to Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPUs, 64GB of RAM (at up to 7200 MT/s, the highest of any Alienware laptop), 12 TB of PCIe Gen 5 SSD storage and next-gen NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPUs. Both models can handle up to 175 watts of total graphics power with an additional 105 watts reserved for the CPU. There's also a glass bottom to help with thermal regulation.&nbsp; 
They should be available sometime in the next couple of months. However, the laptops are launching in high-end configurations that start at $3,200, with less expensive “entry-level” models coming later in the year. 
  
ASUS ROG Flow Z13 
 
 
 
  Engadget
 
 
The ASUS ROG Flow Z13 is a 2-in-1 hybrid that could absolutely shine as a gaming tablet. It supports up to a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 APU with unified memory. The 70Whr battery should get up to 10 hours on a single charge and the IPS panel boasts an impressive 180Hz refresh rate and up to 500 nits of brightness. This machine also integrates with the company’s new XG Mobile graphics dock for a nice little upgrade in the visuals. 
The Flow Z13 is expected to start at around $2,000 for a version with a Ryzen AI Max 390 chip or $2,200 when configured with a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 APU. We don’t have a release date yet.

"The AC Future drivable, self-sustaining home transforms to be larger than your first apartment","The ""AC"" in AC Future stands for Amy and Cindy, founder Arthur Qin's two daughters. That's just one of the bits of info I gained at the company's CES event in which we got a first look at the new AC Future Ai-TH transformable home. This is yet another nattily appointed answer to the housing crisis we've seen on the 2025 show floor. It comes in three models: a deliverable pod (Ai-THu), a pullable trailer (Ai-THt) and a road-ready EV RV (Ai-THd). Press and prospective buyers got to tour the EV prototype this week (but we had to take our shoes off first).&nbsp; 
 
 
 
  Amy Skorheim / Engadget
 
 
Thanks to pull-out sections at the rear and both sides, the bus-sized RV transforms into a 400-square-foot, one bed, one bath apartment, complete with a living room, kitchen with full-sized fridge, two burner induction range and microwave, along with an uncramped stall shower and washer/dryer in the bathroom. The full HVAC system, paired with high-efficiency insulation keeps the unit temperate.&nbsp; 
All that amounts to one heck of a power draw, which AC Future answers with a roof covered in solar panels. I was told all three models of the Ai-TH can generate around 25 kWh of energy in a day. For reference, the average American house uses around 30 kWh daily. The home can also be plugged in if sunlight isn't enough, and there was talk of wind-generation options for customers in cloudy climates.&nbsp; 
All models of the Ai-TH will also come equipped with atmospheric water generation that can suck between 13 and 15 gallons of water per day out of thin air. That's much less than the 200 or so gallons American houses use for non-landscaping needs, so the Ai-TH also recycles gray water and, of course, has a holding tank. In theory, these units can act as fully self-sustaining living pods, gathering what's needed from the world around them.&nbsp;  
Because this is CES 2025, where the unofficial motto is ""Stick some AI in it!"" there's a whole-home proprietary AI assistant called Futura to turn on your lights, manage your resources and handle other management tasks. There was even a demo set up outside the RV letting people ""meet"" ""her."" 
At last year’s CES, AC Future, barely two years old at the time, showed off the idea for the Ai-TH. The fully equipped prototype we saw was built in collaboration with Hydra, an automotive design and prototyping studio out of Southern California. Models that go into production will have components coming from a huge range of suppliers; I was told there are three partners lined up for the EV motors alone.&nbsp; 
AC Future says this is “aimed at addressing the affordable, sustainable and mobile housing crisis worldwide.” And any talk of addressing the housing crisis has to include some discussion of price, unless we're counting on some trickle-down economics-style solutions. The static base model will start at $98,000, the trailer model will go for $138,000 and up and the drivable version starts at $298,000.&nbsp; 
AC Future's COO told me production would begin as soon as they left Vegas (the whole team was at CES) and reservations are open now.&nbsp;

Sony's Afeela 1 feels like a PlayStation 4 in the PS5 era,"While there&#39;s plenty of automotive news to go around at CES 2025, far and away, the talk of the show is the Afeela 1. Again. For five years now, Sony has been showing off some variation on this same theme, first as the Vision-S in 2020, then the Vision-S 02, before adopting the unfortunate rebranding to Afeela in 2023, and this year finally to Afeela 1.
Along the way, the car lost what little interesting styling it had while sticking true to some specifications that sounded good five years ago. Everything just feels a bit off, not the least of which is its starting price: $89,900.
I got a chance to get up close and inside the car, a demo that began with another explanation of what Afeela means. It&#39;s a sort of overwrought portmanteau for the words autonomy, augmentation, and affinity.
This year&#39;s Afeela 1 is little changed from last year&#39;s numberless show car. The only significant visual update is found in the sensor pod protruding from the leading edge of the roof. A LiDAR module now stands proud, along with a couple of cameras on either end, staring in opposite directions, chameleon-style.
While the bug-eyed look is not particularly charming, it is the only bit of visual character in an otherwise bland design. The lone other external talking point is the display embedded in the leading edge of the hood. This &quot;media bar&quot; is another thing that seemed novel and fun a few years ago on a concept car.
There&#39;s a noticeable seam where two displays meet on the grille-mounted displays.Tim Stevens for Engadget
It&#39;s supposed to welcome you to the car or provide messages to those around you. But it&#39;s hard to read from afar, and up close you can see the unfortunate seam down the middle where two panels were somewhat crudely joined together to form the thing.
To open the driver&#39;s door, you either tap a button in the app or press a small button embedded in the pillar. There are no door handles to pull, not even a token fin like on the Ford Mustang Mach-E. I couldn&#39;t help asking what do you do if you park in an ice storm and the door is frozen shut. I wasn&#39;t given much of an answer.
Those doors open to a space that&#39;s every bit as understated as the exterior except for one thing: the dashboard-spanning display. It&#39;s vibrant and clear and about the only thing in here that reminded me that this is a Sony product. Well, that and the DualSense controller that you can pair to the car and then fire up PS Remote Play while you charge.
And you&#39;ll need something to do because the maximum charge rate of the Afeela 1 is 150 kW for its 91 kWh battery, which provides an estimated 300 miles of range. Compare that to a cheaper Lucid Air, which can charge twice as quickly and cover over 400 miles on a charge, and you begin to see the real problem with this thing.
That display plus the ambient lighting within the car are all comprehensively customizable, with the same sorts of themes available on the PS5. I sampled the Ghost of Tsushima and Fortnite themes, each of which splayed the interior in the proper series of colors, adding a splash of personality to the otherwise vanilla surfaces.
Tim Stevens for Engadget
That big display is the major talking point, but look a little lower and you&#39;ll spot the world&#39;s largest volume knob situated between the seats. It&#39;s bigger than the iDrive knob on most modern BMWs, yet only controls the output of the 28-speaker, Dolby Atmos-enabled sound system.
The software interface, meanwhile, looked largely unfinished, little more than a two-row grid of oversized boxes representing apps, settings and car controls. Given the width of the display, vital controls can easily stretch beyond the driver&#39;s reach, leaving you to drag the whole array back to the left to get what you need.
After so many years of seeing what Sony&#39;s first car would really look like, I couldn&#39;t help feeling disappointed when I climbed out. But not nearly as disappointed as I was when looking down the spec sheet again.
There are two trims of Afeela 1, the $89,900 Afeela 1 Origin and $102,900 Signature. The latter has larger wheels (21-inch vs. 19), a rear-seat entertainment system (displays embedded in the headrests plus an HDMI input) and additional cameras. The Origin, meanwhile, is only available in black.
Seriously.
Tim Stevens for Engadget
Why Sony would even think about launching a $90,000 car that is only available in black is beyond me. Spend the $13,000 more for the Signature model, and you still only get three forgettable shades: white, gray and black again.
In the Origin we have a car that costs $20,000 more than a Lucid Air Pure but has considerably less range and slower charging speed. Go for the $102,900 Afeela 1 Signature trim, and you&#39;re now spending more than a Porsche Taycan, which admittedly has less range but looks far better and will almost assuredly be the more engaging drive.
Five years ago, Sony&#39;s vehicular aspirations made for an odd but intriguing project. Now, it all just seems misguided. How will it feel in another 12 months when the first cars start rolling off from Honda&#39;s Ohio factory? That&#39;s anyone&#39;s guess, but I can&#39;t imagine tomorrow&#39;s market will look any more kindly upon this vehicular curiosity.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sonys-afeela-1-feels-like-a-playstation-4-in-the-ps5-era-184620132.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sonys-afeela-1-feels-like-a-playstation-4-in-the-ps5-era-184620132.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 18:46:20 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
Target Darts is bringing tech smarts to the game,"If there’s one thing that sucks the fun out of darts, it’s the mandatory math you have to do in order to work out how well you’re doing. That’s the malady British manufacturer Target Darts, making its first trip to CES, is solving with its Omni automatic scoring system, saving your beer-drenched brain.&nbsp;
Omni is a halo that magnetically attaches to a compatible board, equipped with four 1080p cameras and an LED light strip. When you throw your darts, the system uses computer vision to identify where they ended up on the board.
From there, the scores will be represented on a nearby computer or tablet, and can even be output to a big TV in the vicinity. Even better, is that you won’t just have your score tracked, but you’ll hear a pre-recorded voice telling you how many points you need to score on your next throw, just as you see in a professional match.
Omni isn’t out just yet, but when it launches, players will be able to use it in conjunction with Target Darts&#39; existing Virt camera. That’s a pair of webcams — one facing the board, one facing the player — that enables darts fans to play against real people online either with friends, or with similarly-ranked strangers.
During the various shelter-in-place orders in force during the COVID pandemic, the UK&#39;s professional darts league actually operated like this for several months. Amusingly one star player, Gary Anderson, was unable to take part in a tournament because his home Wi-Fi wasn&#39;t fast enough to keep up.&nbsp;
Target Darts’ Omni scoring system will start shipping on January 31, and in the UK is priced at £449.95 (around $556). If you’d like to pick up a model in the US, you’ll have to find a reseller, a list of which is available on the company’s website.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/target-darts-is-bringing-tech-smarts-to-the-game-183015898.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/target-darts-is-bringing-tech-smarts-to-the-game-183015898.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 18:30:15 +0000",Sports,www.engadget.com
The WeWalk Smart Cane 2 could be one of AI's few good use cases at CES 2025,"WeWalk introduced a new version of its smart cane for people with visual impairments at CES 2025, bringing a redesign that addresses many of the first model’s shortcomings and adds AI features and more advanced sensors from TDK. It’s positioned as an alternative to the traditional foldable white cane. Co-founder Kursat Ceylan, who has been blind since birth, says Smart Cane 2 can make mobility easier and safer, offering features like turn-by-turn navigation and obstacle detection, along with a ChatGPT-powered voice assistant that puts on-demand information in users’ hands without the need for them to also juggle a smartphone. 
The WeWalk Smart Cane 2 has a slimmer handle than its predecessor, which should make for a more comfortable grip, and the company says it’s now about as lightweight as a standard white cane. It has tactile buttons to be more user-friendly, doing away with the touchpad of the previous model that some people found to be difficult to use. Ceylan says it can be used in different weather conditions, not just when it’s warm and dry (WeWalk describes the new cane as “rainwater-resistant”). 
“You can fold and unfold it when you need it. There's a speaker, a microphone, obstacle detection technology and a flashlight to make visually impaired people more visible at night. And also it has motion sensors in itself to provide a more accurate navigation experience,” Ceylan explained. 
Under the hood, the WeWalk Smart Cane 2 has an ultrasonic time-of-flight sensor, an inertial measurement unit with six-axis motion tracking, a pulse density modulated microphone and a barometric pressure sensor from electronics company TDK. When it detects something ahead, it alerts the user with both haptic and audio feedback, according to Ceylan. 
He demonstrated this in the very cramped, noisy environment of the Las Vegas Convention Center, and I was able to hear over the crowd when the cane told him he was approaching an obstacle — in this case, a carpeted step marked with yellow and black tape that I saw multiple CES attendees stumble over during our conversation. It also can connect to headphones via Bluetooth.

Paired with your smartphone, it can give navigation instructions and information about your surroundings, as well as public transportation options. “You can hear the names of stores and restaurants you are passing by,” he says. In Starbucks, where he isn’t able to read the menu, he says he might ask the assistant if they sell chocolate croissants. 
“You don't need to hold your smartphone anymore while you are going somewhere,” Ceylan said. “You can put it into your pocket and then you can get all the information through your WeWalk smart cane.” There is a smartphone interface for those who want to use it, though, which he held up through the demo so I could see what was going on on the other end. Unlike the vast majority of products I’ve encountered at CES this year that seem to include AI or ChatGPT for no real reason other than the fact that they can, this actually felt like a situation where it makes sense and could even be pretty beneficial. 
Since it’s brand new, we don’t yet know how all of this will translate to real-world use. Pre-orders are now open for the WeWalk Smart Cane 2, and the first wave is expected to start shipping before the end of this month. There are two price models: $850 for the smart cane plus a subscription for the voice assistant that costs $4.99 per month, or $1150 altogether with no additional subscription fee for full use of the AI. WeWalk Smart Cane 2 is available internationally. 
The London-based startup also has a partnership with the Canadian National Institute for the Blind (CNIB) that kicks off in February, when the organization will start using the WeWalk Smart Cane 2 for its cane training program. The goal is to gather meaningful data for instructors so they can really understand how people are using mobility canes (AI-enabled or otherwise), and help them get the most out of the tools. That, Ceylan says, “is so important, because the better you get around, the better you engage in life.”

Former MoviePass head pleads guilty to securities fraud,"“A Florida man pleaded guilty today,” began a Department of Justice press release published on Tuesday. In this case, the ever-infamous Florida Man is none other than Ted Farnsworth, the former CEO of MoviePass’ parent company. His plea comes fewer than four months after another MoviePass leader, former CEO Mitch Lowe, entered a guilty plea of his own.
Farnsworth pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud and another of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. He’ll face a maximum of 20 years in prison for the former charge and up to five for the latter. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled later.
The DOJ charged Farnsworth, 62, with scheming to defraud investors in MoviePass’ former parent company, Helios &amp; Matheson Analytics (HMNY). The agency accused him of making false and misleading representations of HMNY’s and MoviePass’ business to artificially inflate stock and woo investors.
If that sounds familiar, it’s because former MoviePass CEO Mitch Lowe pleaded guilty to the same charges in September. Lowe reportedly agreed to cooperate with prosecutors and regulators as part of his plea, a detail one can imagine tightened the vise on Farnsworth leading up to his plea.
MoviePass subscribers paid the company $9.95 monthly for what were supposed to be unlimited movie tickets with no blackout dates. Farnsworth and Lowe told investors the business plan was tested and sustainable and would at least break even — if not turn a profit — from subscription fees alone. On top of that, they used buzzwords like “big data” and “artificial intelligence” to claim they could alchemize subscriber data, transforming it into profit.
But according to the DOJ (and… logic), that was never the case. Instead, it was a marketing gimmick to lure in new subscribers and pump HMNY’s stock price.
Farnsworth falsely claimed that MoviePass’ cost of goods (the number of tickets each subscriber bought with their subscription) naturally declined over time, which was in line with his publicly stated expectations. But the DOJ says that was because the company directed MoviePass employees to throttle subscribers who used the service to buy the most movies, preventing them from getting what was promised from their “unlimited” memberships. That aligns with reports from 2019 that employees were ordered to change the passwords of frequent moviegoers.
Unsurprisingly, the company lost money from the plan. A downward spiral commenced, MoviePass and its parent company declared bankruptcy in 2020 and the pair of Florida men in charge of the too-good-to-be-true scheme have admitted their guilt in a federal court.
The company has since been resurrected with a new business model after co-founder Stacy Spikes bought its scraps in 2021.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/former-moviepass-head-pleads-guilty-to-securities-fraud-180603455.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/former-moviepass-head-pleads-guilty-to-securities-fraud-180603455.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 18:06:03 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
I want Urtopia’s Titanium Zero concept e-bike,"Broadly speaking, there are two types of e-bikes: Ones with a motor in one of the wheels, and ones with the motor mounted between the pedals. Those in the former group, known as hub motors, are cheap and bountiful, but lack the oomph required to cover rough terrain and high inclines. Those in the latter group, known as mid-drive motors, have all the power, but are heavy on the wallet as well on your arms as you lug them around. Consequently, I’m excited by what Urtopia turned up with to CES 2025: Titanium Zero, a 3D-printed titanium concept e-bike weighing less than 20 pounds packing Quark DM1.2, a custom-designed mid-drive motor that’s small enough to fit inside the bottom bracket and weighs just 2.6 pounds on its own. By its own admission, it’s not as brawny as chonky mid-drive models from Bafang and Bosch, but it might be a perfect alternative for less extreme trails.
Of course, right now it’s just a concept device so we should keep the salt of reasonable skepticism in our left palm at all times. Even so, Urtopia’s Titanium Zero is plenty light enough in the hand, looking a lot more like a regular steel-framed three-speed bike than an e-bike. Hell, if it didn’t have the little controller visible on the crossbar, you could easily mistake this for an old-school racing bike, down to the drop handlebars.
Daniel Cooper for Engadget
And then there’s the aforementioned Quark DM1.2, which adds another layer of theoretical desirability onto the package. Urtopia says the tiny mid-drive motor can produce 65nm of max torque, which isn’t going to give any of the bigger names any nightmares; a Bafang M560 can output 130Nm. But it’s a rough rule of thumb that a regular rear hub motor can output around 40nm, so there’s a significant performance boost. It’s the sort of hardware I’m quite eager to test on the comically steep hills near to my home, just to see if the claims match the reality.
Sadly, the Titanium Zero and Quark DM1.2 aren’t ready for prime time, and so we’ll have to wait for now.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/i-want-urtopias-titanium-zero-concept-e-bike-174539195.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/transportation/i-want-urtopias-titanium-zero-concept-e-bike-174539195.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 17:45:39 +0000",Sports,www.engadget.com
AirStudio One is a portable microphone that’s full of surprises,"This isn’t just any retro-styled microphone, but an all-in-one tool for music creators looking to record vocals when on the go. It’s the creation of Hisong, a startup looking to build a more elegant alternative to toting around a microphone, mixer and headphones wherever you go. The AirStudio One is a wireless condenser microphone with a few secrets buried inside, like a professional audio interface, a wireless USB-C dongle and a pair of true wireless headphones. The idea being you can record a banging vocal when you’re on the road without any additional hardware.&nbsp;
AirStudio One isn’t just a regular microphone, either, since it’s been engineered with a multi-core Digital Signal Processor to help get the best sound from its slender body. Open the companion app on your phone, and you’ll be able to mix the audio, set the EQ and even apply audio effects in real time. This isn&#39;t the first product we&#39;ve seen this CES that puts more of the meat inside the microphone — Shure&#39;s MV7i carries its own two-channel audio interface.&nbsp;
You could also use this to record sound for your videos, and if you opt for the analog dongle, can even output your sound to any device with a 3.5mm line-in. It’s worth saying the ambient noise at CES made it impossible to test the sound quality of microphone. But this is the sort of gadget that has “intriguing prospect” stamped all over it. We’ll likely give this a deeper prod when it’s available to buy later in the year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/airstudio-one-is-a-portable-microphone-thats-full-of-surprises-173019602.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/audio/airstudio-one-is-a-portable-microphone-thats-full-of-surprises-173019602.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 17:30:19 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
One robot vacuum is trying way too hard to outdo the competition at CES 2025,"Robot vacuums are having a very weird year at CES 2025. We’ve seen robot vacs that can scoot over stairs and pick up socks. Now, another robot vacuum maker is showing off robot vacuums that can zoom around with air purifiers, tablet stands, security cameras, tabletops and other objects on top.
The SwitchBot K20+ Pro is a robot vacuum that doubles as a modular platform for other household devices. The company describes it as a “multitasking” household assistant that can perform a bunch of tasks while maybe also cleaning your floor.
The vacuum itself mostly resembles a typical robot vac, if a bit larger. It also has a connector on top that supports a wide array of attachments or even appliances. The company says it can support up to 8 kg — nearly 18 lbs — and will connect seamlessly to other SwitchBot appliances like an air purifier or home security cam. The SwitchBot vac can then be programmed to follow you around or stay in one spot.
Karissa Bell for Engadget
At SwitchBot’s booth, I saw vacuums that had a tablet stand, an air purifier with an attached tabletop and a security cam. But the company’s promotional materials also show a vacuum with a fan and a laundry basket on top. It also suggests that the K20+ Pro can deliver drinks and carry small packages around the house.
A SwitchBot rep at the booth said the company wants to allow people to 3D print their own custom parts for the K20+ Pro so that anyone can come up with their own use case for a vacuum-enabled small appliance. A video posted to the company’s YouTube channel even shows a vacuum with an arm that can pick up trash and deposit it in a wastebasket. (Yes, another robot vacuum with an arm.)
If all of this sounds a bit ridiculous, that’s because it is. While I can kind of understand the appeal of a robot vacuum that doubles as a phone or tablet stand, I can’t imagine many scenarios when I’d want a floor-level fan or air purifier zooming around my house.
I  didn’t get to see any of SwitchBot’s vacuums actually moving around at its booth, so I have no idea how well any of this might work. It’s also not clear how much the K20+ Pro will cost when it goes on sale later this year, though the company is already selling some of its attachments, like the $270 air purifier/tabletop combo.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/one-robot-vacuum-is-trying-way-too-hard-to-outdo-the-competition-at-ces-2025-171554433.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/one-robot-vacuum-is-trying-way-too-hard-to-outdo-the-competition-at-ces-2025-171554433.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 17:15:54 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com

Tonal 2 is now available for purchase,"Tonal, the company behind the smart home gym of the same name, is now launching the Tonal 2. This machine is an upgrade over its predecessor, which we tested some years ago. Two years ago, Tonal laid off 35 percent of its workforce, but the company seems to be doing much better now.
According to the company, Tonal 2 has improved hardware, including a better camera that uses AI to “analyze 500 data points per second” and an upgraded adaptive weight system. The latter can now let users lift up to 250 pounds. Tonal 2 also comes with new Aero HIIT workouts you can follow to combine cardio and strength training, something the first generation trainer doesn’t offer. Additionally, Tonal 2 has a sleeker design and new look, thanks to an all-black appearance with chrome accents.
Like the original Tonal trainer following a few software updates, Tonal 2 knows when your muscles are fatiguing and will reduce the resistance. This adjustment lets you pump out a few more reps and ensure you reach muscle failure easier, increasing muscle gains as a result.
Tonal 2 is now available to purchase in all 50 states for $3,995. This price doesn’t include a subscription, which costs $60 a month. The company will install the machine for you in your home when it arrives.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/tonal-2-is-now-available-for-purchase-170040163.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/tonal-2-is-now-available-for-purchase-170040163.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 17:00:40 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
Google Pixel 4a's update kills its battery life on purpose,"Google’s Pixel 4a has long been considered a great smartphone for those on a budget, but it just received a software update that calls that into question. The update lowers the reported battery life. This isn’t a side-effect of some new software. This is the actual intent of the refresh.
Wait, what? Google says the automatic software update to Android 13 will “reduce your battery&#39;s runtime and charging performance” but that it’s necessary to “improve the stability” of each device. That’s the only explanation the company offered. We reached out to Google to ask for a specific reason as to why this was necessary.
Any other Google Pixel 4a users get an email about a battery update with Android 13 that may affect your phone&#39;s battery? I&#39;m reading this and like...what 😅— Alexis Collins (@Lexiscee) January 7, 2025
 
There’s a silver lining here for current Pixel 4a owners. While every Pixel 4a will receive the automatic update, only certain devices will see a reduction in battery life and charging performance. There’s no information as to what designates which handsets will suffer as a result of the update, but owners of so-called  “impacted devices” will have a few “appeasement options” to choose from.
Folks can send the phone in for a free battery replacement, but that will require the owner to go without a handset while Google performs the replacement. If that’s not viable, the company will send impacted owners $50 or give them a $100 credit toward a new Pixel phone from the Google Store. Pixel 4a owners have one year to choose one of these options.
It’s likely there’s nothing nefarious going on and that Pixel 4a batteries are simply getting old, being as how the phone was released in 2020. This means they may not provide all of the power demanded by the current OS. The software update could be intended to prevent unexpected behavior or shutdowns and the reduction in battery life is an unfortunate side effect.
This whole thing sounds suspiciously similar to when Apple started slowing down older iPhones in 2017. However, Apple wasn’t forthright with consumers during that whole fiasco, leading to court cases and the like. At least Google seems to be getting ahead of things here, even if it could stand to be a bit more transparent.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-pixel-4as-update-kills-its-battery-life-on-purpose-164532917.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-pixel-4as-update-kills-its-battery-life-on-purpose-164532917.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 16:45:32 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
Delta changed the game for CES press conferences,"The CES keynote will never be the same.&nbsp;
This is my 12th CES, so there aren&#39;t many things that surprise me at this point, at least in terms of press conferences. All of the big companies used to try to one-up each other (celebrity appearances were the main method, although it&#39;s not as common now). However, the venue itself has now become the battleground for CES addresses.&nbsp;
This week, Delta was the first company to host a CES press conference, or as the emcee called it, &quot;a show,&quot; at the Sphere in Las Vegas. You&#39;ve likely heard about the high-tech venue at this point, which usually hosts immersive concerts rather than trade show events. Debuting in 2023, the &quot;multi-sensory experience&quot; is known for having both the interior and exterior draped in LED displays and offering 4D effects like wind and smells.&nbsp;
Three different credentials were required to attend the event in the venue which holds 18,600 people, one of which required a special trip to obtain. Once inside, Delta had various installations to celebrate its 100th anniversary and lines for the company&#39;s merchandise were absurdly long. People even skipped the Lenny Kravitz performance at the end to queue up for those goods.&nbsp;
You could hear every realistic boom and pop.Billy Steele for Engadget
There was also food that may have been similar to what the airline serves in-flight, and snacks that you&#39;d expect on a Delta trip, like Biscoff cookies. Of course, the company stacked the audience with employees and guests, plus it trotted out a couple of celebrities — Viola Davis and Tom Brady — which I saw as a throwback to the CES keynote days of old. Then there was the full-blown concert at the end: Lenny Kravitz with a full band. This gave the attendees the experience of coming to a concert at Sphere, where U2, Dead &amp; Company, Phish and more have performed in the past.&nbsp;
But, as you might expect, the most interesting aspect of the whole thing is how Delta took advantage of the Sphere&#39;s 4D capabilities. Video of each speaker was projected on the interior of the venue set on various backdrops that transformed the hall into spaces ranging from a dome to an observation deck and an airplane cabin. Several times during CEO Ed Bastian&#39;s address there were interactions with planes where the seats rumbled and blown air provided a sense of flying, complete with directional, immersive audio. There was also a cameo by Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi where an Uber Eats delivery arrived at the stage with a hazelnut-flavored coffee for Bastian and those aromas were wafted into the audience.&nbsp;
Perhaps the most dazzling aspect of the whole &quot;show&quot; was the end, where cockpit video of a plane landing was projected on the interior of the Sphere. And when the plane landed, everyone&#39;s seats rumbled just liked they do when you hit the tarmac in real life. This was quickly followed by my first indoor fireworks show, designed to cap off Delta&#39;s 100th anniversary. I will say the immersive audio of the Sphere really enhanced this, and I doubt I&#39;ll experience anything like it again. I feel confident I&#39;ll never see indoor fireworks unless I return to this very venue.&nbsp;
Seats rumbled just like they would in real life.Billy Steele for Engadget
Of course, there was news. It wouldn&#39;t be a CES press event without some. Delta announced its AI Concierge, an assistant inside the Fly Delta app that the company built to relieve travel stress. The airline first announced the concierge concept at CES 2020, but now it&#39;s working to make it a real thing that anticipates travel needs. Beginning this year, customers will be able to interact with Delta Concierge via text or voice. Eventually, the platform will be able to do things like hail a Joby VTOL aircraft to drop you off at the airport to avoid traffic.
The AI tech can recognize both departure and arrival needs, including arranging a rideshare pickup for transport to a hotel. At the airport, you won&#39;t have to go through a TSA checkpoint, you just keep walking to your gate thanks to PreCheck Touchless ID. If you&#39;re wearing AR glasses during your trip, wayfinding then becomes a breeze with the travel assistant lighting your path. And once you&#39;re on the plane, the Delta Concierge will eventually automatically connect you to Delta Sync Wi-Fi and the seatback entertainment system to display customized info and content recs just for you.&nbsp;
Delta&#39;s event was easily the most impressive CES presentation I&#39;ve attended. And I&#39;ve been to press events where each person had a PC and a VR headset at their seat. I don&#39;t know that any other company will invest what the airline did in the hosting and production this week, but it was immediately apparent that the bar had been raised, and that a ballroom at Mandalay Bay or The Venetian will no longer suffice if you&#39;re looking to make a lasting impression.
Lenny Kravitz closed the show, and he&#39;ll close this post. Billy Steele for Engadget

"Someone please buy me this battery-powered, plug-in induction range from CES","I don't want or need 99 percent of the stuff on display at CES — don't get me wrong, most of what we're seeing this week is impressive in one way or another, but nothing had seemed like a necessary addition to my life until I happened upon the Copper Charlie, a battery-equipped induction range that plugs directly into a standard 120V outlet. Yes, among the robots, future cars, bionic exoskeletons and AI everything, the thing that's exited me most is a stove (OK, the fluffball robot is pretty great).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Up until a few years ago, I had no idea natural gas cooktops were bad for your health, not to mention the environment. Unfortunately, if your home is set up on gas, it's not easy or cheap to switch up to electric. Nearly all full-sized induction stoves require a dedicated 240V outlet and if you don't have one where the stove goes, a call to a electrician is likely in your future.&nbsp; 
Charlie is a full-sized oven and range that packs a ceramic glass cooktop, a 4.5 cubic-foot oven and an integrated 5 kWh battery. That battery allows the stove to run off a standard plug by storing up a charge that can bump up the power output when it's time to cook (it can also cook three to five meals during a power outage).&nbsp;

In person, the range looks properly high-end with a large LCD display, wooden dials and handle, stainless steel finish and clean lines. It also has a high-end price tag at $6,000. It should qualify for a 30-percent tax credit as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, so it could end up costing around $4,200 instead.&nbsp; 
A rewiring job for a 240V outlet shouldn't run you more than $500 for the average house, though if you're dealing with an older home with tricky wiring, that price could go up. And if you're in an apartment, that may not be an option at all. Still, after rebates and deducting the cost of an outlet conversion, you're still paying around $3,500 for Charlie. That's cheaper than some induction ranges, more expensive than others — but none of those models have a back-up battery that'll let you make mac and cheese when the power goes out.&nbsp; 
The Charlie from Copper is expected to ship in April of this year and is open for pre-orders.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Meta test will bring eBay listings to Facebook Marketplace,"Meta is expanding Facebook Marketplace to include eBay listings. A test will launch in the US, France and Germany, allowing users to browse eBay offerings on Marketplace. Sellers on eBay can list products as usual and ""as long as your account is in good standing, your listings could appear on any of these partners, including Facebook Marketplace, based on user interest, shopping trends, and listing quality,"" eBay states. The company will continue to handle all product inquiries and transactions.
The decision by Meta comes as an attempt to placate the European Union, which fined the tech company €797.12 million ($821 million) last November. The European Commission charged Meta with violating antitrust regulations as ""Meta tied its online classified ads service Facebook Marketplace to its personal social network Facebook and imposed unfair trading conditions on other online classified ads service providers,"" Margrethe Vestager, then European Commission's executive vice-president in charge of competition policy, said at the time. ""It did so to benefit its own service Facebook Marketplace, thereby giving it advantages that other online classified ads service providers could not match.""&nbsp;
Meta's decision to showcase eBay listings on Facebook Marketplace is far from an admission of guilt. ""While we disagree with and continue to appeal the European Commission’s decision on Facebook Marketplace, we are working quickly and constructively to build a solution which addresses the points raised,"" Meta stated in its announcement.&nbsp;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-test-will-bring-ebay-listings-to-facebook-marketplace-153958205.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-test-will-bring-ebay-listings-to-facebook-marketplace-153958205.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 15:39:59 +0000",Sports,www.engadget.com
T-Mobile is under fire again over its 2021 data breach,"T-Mobile is once again being sued by Washington state over the 2021 data breach which exposed sensitive information for over 79 million people, The Verge reports. The lawsuit filed on Monday alleges that T-Mobile had been aware of various security loopholes in its systems for years but didn’t take any action. As a result, a hacker managed to breach T-Mobile in March 2021 and was undetected until August of the same year when an “anonymous cybersecurity threat intelligence firm” told T-Mobile what was happening.
Beyond alleging that T-Mobile knew about these flaws and took inadequate action to fix them, Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson also claims T-Mobile’s notifications to customers affected by the breach were inadequate and misleading. The text messages were brief and didn’t reveal the full scope of the breach, only telling customers that debit and credit card information wasn’t exposed while failing to mention their social security numbers and other personally identifiable information were compromised.
The breach&#39;s victims included two million Washington residents. Information from T-Mobile&#39;s databases was later on the dark web for sale to the highest bidder. T-Mobile even supposedly hired a third party to buy exclusive access to the data.
In more than one sense, this isn’t T-Mobile’s first rodeo. The company was already sued by AG Ferguson over a decade ago over &quot;deceptive&quot; ads. It has also been the target of a breach since 2021 — specifically 2024 “Salt Typhoon” attacks on commercial telecommunications companies. T-Mobile claims that its systems and data weren’t impacted significantly.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/t-mobile-is-under-fire-again-over-its-2021-data-breach-143007400.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/t-mobile-is-under-fire-again-over-its-2021-data-breach-143007400.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 14:30:07 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
NASA will decide how to bring soil samples back from Mars in 2026,"NASA will analyze and explore two different landing options for its Mars Sample Return program, though it will take almost two years to do so and is expected to announce its decision in late 2026. The agency had to temporarily hit pause on the program after an independent review found that it could cost between $8 billion and $11 billion, which is way above budget.
The first method NASA is evaluating is called the &quot;sky crane,&quot; in which a vehicle will head to Mars, get close to the surface with the help of a parachute, pick up the samples the Perseverance rover had collected using cables or other mechanisms and then fly away. NASA previously used this method to place the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers on the planet.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, the second option requires the help of commercial space companies. Last year, the agency asked SpaceX, Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin and other companies to submit proposals on how to get the collected Martian samples back to Earth. Whichever option the agency chooses will carry a smaller version of the Mars Ascent Vehicle than originally planned. The Mars Ascent Vehicle is a lightweight rocket that will take the samples from the planet&#39;s surface into Martian orbit. It will also have to be capable of transporting a container that can fit 30 sample tubes. Once the sample container is in orbit, a European Space Agency orbiter will capture it and bring it back home.&nbsp;
Early last year, NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory had to lay off 530 employees and cut off 100 contract workers mainly due to budget issues related to this mission. NASA requested $950 million for the program, but only $300 million was allocated for it. The independent review that found that the mission would cost above budget also found that it might not be able to bring the samples back to Earth by 2040. According to a previous report by The Washington Post, the US government found the return date &quot;unacceptable.&quot;
In a teleconference, NASA administrator Bill Nelson revealed either of the two methods the agency is now considering would cost a lot less than what it would originally spend. The sky crane would reportedly cost NASA between $6.6 billion and $7.7 billion, while working with a private space company would cost between $5.8 billion and $7.1 billion. Either option would also be able to retrieve the samples and bring them back sometime between 2035 and 2039. Scientists believe the samples Perseverance has been collecting could help us determine whether there was life on Mars and whether its soil contains chemicals and substances that could be harmful to future human spacefarers.&nbsp;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-will-decide-how-to-bring-soil-samples-back-from-mars-in-2026-141519710.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-will-decide-how-to-bring-soil-samples-back-from-mars-in-2026-141519710.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 14:15:19 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
Pick up a four-pack of Apple AirTags for only $70,"If you want to keep better track of your things in the new year, a Bluetooth tracker can help. Apple’s AirTags are currently on sale where you can get a four pack for only $70. That’s a record low for the bundle and it brings each individual device down to only $17.50. If you’re not so sure you need four of them, a single AirTag will set you back $23 at the moment. 
AirTags take just seconds to set up using an iPhone. They are integrated into the Find My network, so you don't have to register for another service or download a separate app. AirTags also support the ultra-wideband wireless protocol. When your iPhone gets within roughly 25 feet of a linked AirTag, you'll see directional arrows and an approximate distance meter to help you locate it. 
  
On top of that, Apple recently revealed that several major airlines are adding support for AirTag tracking to their systems. The idea is to help you (and your airline) more easily locate any missing bag that has an AirTag inside. 
Meanwhile, you might be interested in picking up some AirTag accessories to, say, more easily attach them to your keychain. We've got you covered there too, thanks to our round-up of the best AirTag accessories.

Sony's immersive The Last of Us experience at CES 2025 dropped me into a subway filled with zombies,"As Engadget's chief The Last of Us correspondent, I was pretty pumped to find out during Sony's CES 2025 press conference that season two of the HBO show would come out in April. But Naughty Dog head Neil Druckmann also teased a ""location-based experience exhibit"" that would transport participants into the tunnels of Seattle filled with Infected. That's an area straight out of The Last of Us Part II, and today I got a chance to try the proof-of-concept experience. It was short, minimal, and a little rough, but it was also another good example of how Sony is trying to take its tentpole franchises from PlayStation and put them in entirely different experiences.
Unfortunately, Sony had a strict ""no cameras or videos"" policy for this experience, so you'll have to rely on my words and a little video the company showed about the tech behind it.
I entered the experience with three other participants after a quick run-down of the gear we'd use: two of us got shotguns, and two got flashlights (sadly I was stuck with a flashlight). Both have a bunch of small sensors attached to the front so that they could interact with the environment we entered; the flashlight felt like a real flashlight with some sensors on the end, but the guns were crude tubes with a handle and trigger; the trigger felt pretty good from my quick test of it before we got started. There are also sensors on the barrel of the gun that detect a ""pump"" motion to reload it.
Once we were outfitted, an actor playing a member of an unnamed militia briefed us on the mission: some of our fellow mercenaries disappeared in the Seattle subways — perhaps kidnapped by the WLF, perhaps taken down by Infected. Our job was to find him... what could go wrong?&nbsp;
Our guide directed me and the other flashlight-holder to start lighting up the subway station — which was created by three giant screens surrounding us. The walls of the room were made of LED panels, and the sensors on the flashlights interacted with them to track my moment. I needed to be pretty close to the screens for it to recognize my flashlight, but it was pretty cool to be lighting up a virtual environment in real time.&nbsp;
Nathan Ingraham for Engadget
Then, of course, a clicker scream puts the group on high alert — and given that it came from a specific location we all swing our flashlights in that direction to identify the threat. Just as in the game, though, the disgusting infected creature shambled closer to us, let out another scream and came charging forward, at which point the shotgunners blasted away with abandon. That noise brought more Infected charging into the space; I would light them up with the flashlight and my partner shot them down.&nbsp;
Things calmed down, momentarily — then a massive subway car started sliding out of its precarious place, which trigged one of the demo's coolest effects. The floor was rigged for haptic feedback, and while we had felt it rumble at various disturbances, this was by far the biggest impact. The combo of the visuals, audio and haptics all made it feel, well, immersive. I certainly didn't forget I was in a demo, but it was cool nonetheless. Beyond the floor haptics, Sony says that there are even scents pumped into the room to further the atmosphere, but I wasn't able to detect anything myself.
Then we got the obligatory cameo from The Last of Us Part II co-protagonist Ellie and her companion Dina, as they scrambled away from Infected who start chasing them down. One knocked Ellie down and started ripping at her throat until Dina caught up and pulled it off her, at which point they sprinted away. Unfortunately, the disturbance brought a massive swarm of monsters coming at us, which brought on the  big battle of the experience. I started illuminating the hordes and my companion blasted them down, but then dozens started overwhelming the screens and the screams got more and more intense until everything cut to black as our crew was overrun. That's that!&nbsp;
I'm not judging the experience too harshly, because Sony was clear both in its press conference and before we tried it that this is a very early proof of concept. The main thing that pulled me out of it was that the space we were in is static — there's no way to run away or move beyond the boundaries of what we were presented with. And then, as I mentioned, you needed to be relatively close to the ""walls"" for them to recognize the flashlight or gun, which meant that if you backed up to take in the scope of the space you gear might not work.&nbsp;
The other barrier to it being truly scary or more immersive is that I couldn't ignore the fact that the threat was on a screen rather than in the room with me. There's no doubt that having full control in an environment like this would be a wild way to play a game like this, but it was all just a little too on the rails and removed from the space I was in.
I'm trying to track down anyone from Sony who can tell me more about the genesis for this idea as well as where they see it going in the future. But Sony and Naughty Dog have already brought The Last of Us to a variety of other media, and this feels like a more high-tech vision of what Sony did in conjunction with Universal Studios when it brought the franchise to the Halloween Horror Nights that happens at the theme parks. Whether this is a one-off curiosity or something we see down the line in a more complete fashion, though, remains to be seen.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sonys-immersive-the-last-of-us-experience-at-ces-2025-dropped-me-into-a-subway-filled-with-zombies-140010550.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sonys-immersive-the-last-of-us-experience-at-ces-2025-dropped-me-into-a-subway-filled-with-zombies-140010550.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 14:00:10 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
A closer look at the slick Honda 0 SUV and Saloon prototypes at CES 2025,"Last year, Honda teased its first two homegrown EVs with the Series 0 Saloon and Space-Hub. But now at CES 2025, those vehicles are getting one step closer to production by graduating from concepts to prototypes while getting updated names along the way: the Honda 0 Saloon and 0 SUV.
But while we wait for them to officially hit the road sometime in 2026, I wanted to take a closer look at the evolved styling of Honda’s upcoming electric cars. Particularly the 0 SUV, not only because it’s gotten a much larger facelift, but lets admit it, it’s what we in the crossover-hungry US really want.
Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget
On the outside, the Honda’s 0 SUV looks like a mix between the Polestar 3 and the Hyundai Ioniq 9. It’s got a really minimalist, almost spaceship-like design that eschews that teardrop shape you see in a lot of other EV SUVs for something slightly boxier. This gives you more headroom for rear seat passengers and tons of extra vertical cargo space in back. The SUV’s pixelated headlights help reinforce its digital pedigree while I think Honda did a much better job in back of trying to make a clean and simple rear end without ending up a huge blank slate like on the Ioniq 9.
The 0 SUV’s overall proportions almost make it look like a tall, lifted wagon, especially when sat next to the 0 saloon. But that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Inside, Honda continues with the clean lines, though I wouldn’t necessarily read much into the general placement and look of its screens and dash. Like a lot of pre-production cars, those details are very much subject to change before its design is properly finalized. Same goes for those side-view cameras, which due to US laws, still don’t comply with regulations. However, Honda’s streamlined cabin does line up with the company’s “Thin, Light and Wise” design philosophy, which includes the move to a steer-by-wire driving system instead of relying on more traditional physical linkages.
But enough talking, let’s check out the cars.

This spinning VR chair at CES 2025 somehow didn't make me feel like throwing up,"A spinning VR gaming chair sounds like it would be an at-home vomitron. The virtual reality environment tends to make some people (like me) queasy as it is, so adding synchronized full-body rotation seems like a recipe for disaster. I was kind of prepared for the worst when I decided to try out the $800 Roto VR Explorer at CES 2025, which uses a head-tracker that attaches to the top of Meta Quest devices and other headsets to make a swivel chair turn in whatever direction you’re looking. But against all odds, I ended up having a pretty good time. 
In addition to enhancing the experience of seated VR gaming, the chair is actually supposed to help with issues like motion sickness, because, according to the press materials, “the signals from your inner ear will match what your brain is expecting from the visual cues.” Still, I was a little nervous, and it didn’t help that as we approached the booth, the first thing we saw was an empty chair spinning on its own in the corner like an omen. 
 
  
 
 
The Roto VR Explorer is a Made for Meta product, meaning it’s optimized for Quest, but it’ll work with standalone headsets like those in the HTC Vive family and “soon” the Apple Vision Pro. The chair itself weighs 66 pounds, so it felt really sturdy to sit in, and it has a rumble pack under the seat to bring haptic feedback to the rest of your body instead of just in your hands from the controllers. The head tracker, which looks like a flattened Poké Ball, clips onto the top strap of the headset. 
After the Roto team gave me the rundown and got me set up in the chair with a Quest 3, I selected my VR experience — the 2018 interactive documentary about the universe, Spheres — and got going. It was, without a doubt, a little weird at first when I turned my head to follow the path of rippling auroras and felt my body rotate as if I were a spice jar on a lazy Susan. But for the most part, it didn’t have that disorienting feeling of the ground shifting underneath you. (It was definitely lagging a bit on the congested show floor, which did lead to some out-of-sync, jerky movements). It only took a minute or so for me to stop focusing on the fact that I was in motion and just go with it.

For something like Spheres, where you’re just sort of moseying through beautiful visuals and curiously interacting with the virtual environment, the Roto VR Explorer is actually really nice. If you’re in a faster-paced setting, like a first-person shooter, it’s only going to ramp up the tension. I tried turning my head quickly to the side back and forth a few times to see how it would work with that sort of movement, and it really goes when it’s running smoothly. The chair moves at max speed of 21 revolutions per minute, but you can reduce this with the controllers if that gets to be too much. 
I fully expected to be doing a lot of deep breathing to get through the demo, but there actually never was a point that I felt nauseated. And when I got up out of it and reentered real life, I didn’t feel any more wobbly-legged and confused than I usually do after spending time behind a headset (though I’m sure using it for a few hours straight would change that). I'm mostly just relieved I didn't throw up in front of a bunch of strangers.&nbsp; 
There are plenty of situations in which a person might want or need to do their VR gaming sitting down, and the Roto VR Explorer chair offers a pretty fun way to bring the immersion to another level. It’s available for purchase now, with upgrade packages — including Pro Flying and Pro Racing — expected to follow in August 2025.

Former Annapurna Interactive staff are reportedly taking over publisher Private Division's game portfolio,"Ex-employees of Annapurna Interactive who quit en masse last year have reportedly found their next project. According to Bloomberg, the team is taking over the games and franchises of Private Division, a former Take-Two label that published indie games.
A new enterprise that doesn&#39;t have a name as yet is said to have been formed and it appears that some of the remaining 20 or so employees of Private Division will be laid off as part of the transition. Take-Two said in November that it had sold Private Division (which published The Outer Worlds and physical copies of Hades) to an unnamed buyer, reportedly a private equity firm called Haveli Investments.
Haveli is said to have brought in the former Annapurna employees in recent weeks and handed them the keys to Private Division&#39;s portfolio. That includes an upcoming cozy life sim based on The Lord of the Rings called Tales of the Shire, the Kerbal Space Program series and a new project from Game Freak, which is best known for making Pokémon games.
The entire Annapurna Interactive staff quit last summer after discussions to spin out the publisher from parent company Annapurna Pictures fell apart. The company then set out to replace the team.
Annapurna has a stellar track record in the indie realm, having published a string of highly regarded games such as Stray, Sayonara Wild Hearts, What Remains of Edith Finch, Cocoon and (slightly confusingly) Outer Wilds. So there’s reason for optimism that its former staffers can do great things with the Private Division portfolio. Fingers crossed that this also somehow portends a future for OlliOlli and the brilliant Rollerdrome. Both were developed by Roll7, a now-shuttered studio that was under Private Division’s umbrella.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/former-annapurna-interactive-staff-are-reportedly-taking-over-publisher-private-divisions-game-portfolio-133033714.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/former-annapurna-interactive-staff-are-reportedly-taking-over-publisher-private-divisions-game-portfolio-133033714.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 13:30:33 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
Devices with strong cybersecurity can now apply for a government seal of approval,"In summer 2023, the Biden administration announced its plan to certify devices with a logo indicating powerful cybersecurity. Now, as Biden navigates his last couple weeks in office, the White House has  launched the US Cyber Trust Mark. The green shield logo will adorn any product which passes accreditation tests established by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).&nbsp;
The program will open to companies &quot;soon,&quot; allowing them to submit products to an accredited lab for compliance testing. &quot;The US Cyber Trust Mark embodies public-private collaboration,&quot; the White House stated in a release. &quot;It connects companies, consumers, and the US government by incentivizing companies to build products securely against established security standards and gives consumers an added measure of assurance — through the label — that their smart device is cybersafe.&quot; Some companies, like Best Buy and Amazon, plan to showcase labeled products for consumer&#39;s easy discovery.
Steps to get the program up and running have continued over the last year and a half. In March, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the program in a bipartisan, unanimous vote. Last month, the Commission issued 11 companies with conditional approval to act as Cybersecurity Label Administrators.&nbsp;
The White House&#39;s original announcement included plans to also create a QR code linking to a database of the products — its unclear if this aspect will move forward. The QR code would allow customers to check if the product was up-to-date with its cybersecurity checks.&nbsp;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/devices-with-strong-cybersecurity-can-now-apply-for-a-government-seal-of-approval-131553198.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/devices-with-strong-cybersecurity-can-now-apply-for-a-government-seal-of-approval-131553198.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 13:15:53 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
RollAway is a rentable EV camper van with a concierge service and luxury amenities,"RollAway combines the luxuries of a high-end hotel with the freedom of camping, all in a drivable, eco-friendly package. RollAway is a camper-van rental service that offers an on-demand concierge who can plan your trip, direct you along the way, provide tips about the best spots to visit, and keep your space equipped with five-star amenities. The van has a seating area that transforms into a queen bed, a kitchen with a sink and dual-burner stovetop, a shower, toilet, lots of storage, and a panoramic roof. When the van’s rear rolling door is pulled down, it acts as a screen for the included projector. 
But that’s just all the built-in stuff. RollAway also comes with a lineup of top-tier amenities, including Yeti coolers and cups, Starlink satellite Wi-Fi, locally sourced breakfast packages, Malin+Goetz toiletries, fresh linens, and a tablet loaded with hospitality services. The tablet gives you access to a live virtual concierge and the Hospitality On-Demand app, which houses your itinerary, room service and housekeeping requests. In the future, RollAway will offer a full housekeeping service, but that feature isn’t live quite yet. 
 
 
 
  RollAway
 
 
Best of all, RollAway is a sustainability-focused, zero-emissions endeavor. The vans are fully electric, courtesy of GM’s EV subsidiary BrightDrop, and they have a single-charge range of more than 270 miles. They also have a fast charging option. The vans have solar panels, a waterless toilet, and low-waste water systems for serious off-grid trips, or they can be fully hooked up at RV sites. 
We took a quick tour of a RollAway van at CES 2025 and found it to be as luxurious as advertised. The kitchen table slides into the seating area when it’s not in use, creating a fairly open hangout space at the very back of the van. The kitchen felt plenty large for camping purposes, and the most cramped space was the bathroom, which held a toilet and a sliver of a hand-washing sink. All of the finishing touches seemed sturdy and looked sleek. We were deeply tempted to drive right off the show floor in the thing.

RollAway just started booking trips in late 2024, and the service is almost fully reserved throughout 2025. Reservations cost around $400 a night. It’s available only in the San Francisco Bay Area for now, but more cities are coming soon. RollAway had a successful funding round on Indiegogo in 2023, raising more than $47,000 of a $20,000 goal.

The Morning After: Meta gives up on fact checking for Facebook and Instagram,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced yesterday that the company is swinging away from its efforts to corral its content. Meta is suspending its fact-checking program to move to an X-style Community Notes model on Facebook, Instagram and Threads. We go into detail on the changes Meta promised, but is the company attempting to court the new Trump presidency?
Well, alongside donating to Donald Trump’s inauguration fund, replacing policy chief Nick Clegg with a former George W. Bush aide and even adding Trump’s buddy (and UFC CEO) Dana White to its board… yeah. Probably.
Meta blocked Trump from using his accounts on its platforms for years after he stoked the flames of the attempted coup of January 6, 2021. At the time, Zuckerberg said, “His decision to use his platform to condone rather than condemn the actions of his supporters at the Capitol building has rightly disturbed people in the US and around the world.”
But who cares about that when you could get some sweet favor with the incoming administration? Zuckerberg, who revealed the change on Fox News, said Trump’s election win is part of the reasoning behind Meta’s policy shift, calling it “a cultural tipping point” on free speech. He said the company will work with Trump to push back against other governments, including China.
He added, “Europe has an ever-increasing number of laws institutionalizing censorship and making it difficult to build anything innovative there.” It’s not innovative to copy everything rival social networks do, Mark. Also, pay your fines, Mark.
Alongside Zuckerberg’s video, Meta had a blog post — “More Speech and Fewer Mistakes” — detailing incoming changes and policy shifts — or more lies and fewer consequences.

Gemini AI smarts are coming to Google Home
Making the assistant a better conversationalist.
Google is integrating Gemini capabilities into its smart home platform via devices, like the Nest Audio, Nest Hub and Nest Cameras, and at CES we finally got to see them in action. The main takeaway is that conversations with Google Assistant will feel more natural. Possibly the most impressive trick we saw was the case of the missing cookies. The rep asked the Nest Hub what happened to the cookies on the counter, and it pulled footage from a connected Nest Cam, showing a dog walking into a kitchen, swiping a cookie and scampering off. Cheeky. These Gemini-improved smarts will reach Nest Aware subscribers in a public preview later this year. Subscribers? Cheeky.
In case you missed it, Gemini is also coming to Google-powered TVs.

The Lenovo Legion Go S is the first third-party SteamOS handheld
There’s also a Windows 11 version that will arrive earlier.
Ready to supplant the beefy Legion Go, Lenovo is announcing a slightly more portable version called the Legion Go S, supporting two OSes: Windows 11 and SteamOS. The specs on both are nearly identical, with either an AMD Ryzen Z2 Go chip or the Z1 Extreme APU Lenovo used on the previous model, up to 32GB of RAM, 1TB SSD and a 55.5Wh battery. Compared to the original Legion Go, the S features a smaller but still large 8-inch 120 Hz OLED display (down from 8.8 inches) with a 1,920 x 1,200 resolution and VRR instead of 2,560 x 1,600 144Hz panel like on the original. That should translate to a better battery life, but we’ll have to see when we eventually get one to test.

The best tech and gadgets we found on CES 2025 Day Two,"It’s the second day of CES 2025, and I’m sure you’ve spent the whole day with your eyes pointed to our liveblog containing all the news of the day. But I’m sure there are a few folks who might have sneezed, or blinked, and missed something important. Which is why we’ve made this lovely list of all the biggest news from this day of the show, just for those folks who sneezed.
Lenovo blesses us with its presence at CES
There was plenty more PC-flavored news broadcast to the world, including Lenovo’s turn in the spotlight. Most notably, it showed off the ThinkBook Plus, a real version of its flexible OLED laptop from a few years back. At the touch of a button, that 14-inch display will expand to a bit more productivity-friendly 16.7-inches, which might justify the $3,500 starting price.
Lenovo also showed off a dummy prototype of its Legion Go 2 gaming handheld, and hints as to what specs it’ll be carrying. Alongside that, it announced the Legion Go S, the first third-party SteamOS gaming handheld that’ll offer a legitimate alternative to the Steam Deck. If you’d rather play games in a more traditional way, by which I mean with one leg as an ersatz table while you sit awkwardly on a crowded bus, then you can opt for Lenovo’s new Legion Pro 7i gaming laptop which can be specced with NVIDIA’s RTX 5090 graphics.
Of course, Lenovo also released some normal laptops, including the Yoga Slim 9i, the first laptop to launch with an under-display camera. The tweak enables it to boast a 98 percent screen to body ratio, which should get all of your friends and enemies feeling jealous. The ThinkPad X9, meanwhile, will likely break hearts of longstanding ThinkPad fans, since it has no aluminum chassis and no Trackpoint. Yes, we can hardly believe it too.

Qualcomm, with less to prove than Intel right now, has announced its Snapdragon X chips will land in more Windows Copilot + PCs in the near future. A plethora of models are currently in development, with a focus on affordability rather than bells and whistles. Qualcomm and its partners, which include Acer, Dell, HP and Lenovo are targeting a base price of $600. Which should be affordable enough for plenty of entry-level buyers to update their ageing hardware to take advantage of whatever we work out what AI is actually good for.
ASUS’ new ZenBook A14 made its debut in the desert, showing off some pretty lovely industrial design and a spec sheet to match. Engadget’s Devindra Hardawar was delighted with the premium materials used in its construction, and the look and feel. The one downside is that it’s equipped / blighted (delete as appropriate) with Qualcomm’s X or Elite chips, limiting backwards compatibility with older Windows apps.
Maingear, meanwhile, went to town on its fancy-looking water-cooled desktops as it attempts to reassert its dominance in the custom PC space. The range comes with heavy-duty plumbing and a whole bunch of fans and radiators to help keep your planet-burning GPUs cool.
One permanent fixture of CES 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada is gaming company Razer showing off its latest lighting-infused hardware. First up, it debuted its new Blade 16 laptop, which it says is its thinnest gaming laptop ever made. It also showed off Project Arielle, an RGB-clad gaming chair that’ll glow red as it warms you up and blue as it cools you down. And, to round things out, the company also showed off a fancypants monitor stand that, surprise surprise, was also RGB.
Smart Glasses at CES 2025
Smart glasses have always been something of a technological cul-de-sac, but the signs are that the technology is quickly maturing. We’ve seen plenty of specs at this year’s CES that aren’t just a faddy gimmick with a too-expensive price tag. For instance, RayNeo’s new X3 AR Pro frames comes with a built-in camera and the ability to interact with a ChatGPT-powered assistant. Then there’s Even Realities, which brought the G1A and G1B to the show, which impressed me no end. They’re far lower tech than some of the products on offer, but with a more robust feature set that includes real-time translation, teleprompting and turn-by-turn directions. Xreal, too, was able to show off its latest personal cinema-style AR glasses that didn’t make me want to throw up the second I put them on.
The CES Auto Show: New Honda EVs and BMW’s Panoramic iDrive turn heads
Honda rocked up in Nevada to talk up prototype models of the concept vehicles it showed off last year. The 0 Series Saloon sedan, which 100% looks like the car Inspector Gadget would drive, and the 0 Series SUV, which also looks like a car Inspector Gadget would drive. The auto maker said both models will be available to buy at some point next year, harnessing Honda’s brand-spanking new EV architecture.
And BMW was also here, showing off its new Panoramic iDrive system that’ll come to every new BMW. That includes a display running the width of the dashboard with key statistics on your drive, rather than sticking it in an instrument binnacle like a normal person is used to. Of course, the idea here is to give you so many places to stick useful information it’s impossible for you to miss what’s going on. Unless you spend so much time staring at the raft of digital displays that you forget your eyes should really be pointed toward the road.
The rest of the best at CES 2025
Day two of CES is where the focus pivots from the biggest names to everyone else, and there was plenty of interesting stuff on show. For instance, InkPoster uses color e-paper displays as a canvas upon which you can hang digital art on your walls. MCON by OhSnap is a neat magnetic game controller for your smartphone with high-class features like Hall Effect Joysticks. Anker built a solar umbrella that lets you re-juice your gadgets while catching some rays. And, not one to be outdone, EcoFlow showed off a solar hat that’ll do the same thing, but goofier.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/the-best-tech-and-gadgets-we-found-on-ces-2025-day-two-110005772.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/general/the-best-tech-and-gadgets-we-found-on-ces-2025-day-two-110005772.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 11:00:05 +0000",Sports,www.engadget.com
The best Android phones for 2025,"Choosing the best Android phone can feel overwhelming as there are so many options from so many brands, it’s hard to know where to start. Unlike Apple, which sticks to its sleek lineup of iPhones, Android offers a world of variety. Whether you're eyeing the latest flagship from Samsung, a budget-friendly smartphone from Motorola or something unique with a foldable design, there’s an Android device out there to suit your needs.The beauty of Android is its flexibility. You’ll find phones with different screen sizes, camera setups, battery life and even quirky extras like stylus support or rugged builds. Plus, Android lets you customize your device to your heart's content – something Apple fans might envy. We’ve tested and researched the top Android phones to help you find the right one for your budget, lifestyle, and tech preferences. 
What to look for in a new Android phone 
Performance 
When it comes to picking our favorite Android phones, the main things we look for are pretty straightforward: good performance (both compute and AI), a nice display, solid design, sharp cameras, long battery life and a significant commitment to ongoing software support. For performance, not only do we look at benchmarks and other metrics, but we also evaluate phones based on responsiveness. Regardless of whether you’re reading, text messaging, scrolling through social media or playing a game, no one wants a gadget that feels sluggish. 
Display 
 
 
 
  Sam Rutherford/Engadget
 
 
When it comes to displays, we generally prefer OLED panels that can produce rich, saturated colors with at least 600 nits of brightness, though many of our top mid-range and high-end phones can hit 1,000 nits or more. And more recently, most of our favorite devices also support screens with fast refresh rates of 90Hz or 120Hz, which adds an extra level of smoothness and fluidity. 
Design 
Now we will admit there is a bit of subjectivity when deciding which phones look the best, but there are other design aspects like dust and water resistance or screen durability that can make a big difference to long-term survival. It’s also important to consider things like support for wireless charging, power sharing (aka reverse wireless charging) and UWB connectivity, which can have an impact on how your phone interacts with your other devices. 
Cameras 
Obviously, for photos we’re looking for sharp, colorful shots in both bright and low-light conditions. And we want video clips with high dynamic range, rich audio and smooth image stabilization. Extra cameras for ultra-wide and telephoto lenses are a plus. The best cameras should also include features like dedicated night modes, support for various video recording resolutions, and additional photo modes like timelapse, slow motion and more. 
Battery and software 
Finally, in terms of longevity, we’re looking for all-day battery life on devices that also delivered great results on our local video rundown test (at least 16 hours on a charge, but more is obviously better). Wireless charging capabilities have become almost ubiquitous over the past few years, and most of our top picks have this extra perk. Fast-charging is available on some Android phones, too. Finally, with people holding onto their phones longer than ever, we like to see companies commit to at least three years of software support, upgrades and regular security updates.

More than one company brought a robot vacuum with a mechanical arm to CES 2025,"It turns out that Roborock isn’t the only company that brought a robot vacuum with a mechanical arm to CES 2025. Rival company Dreame, which unveiled its stair-climbing robot vacuum earlier in the week, is also working on a robot vacuum with an arm for picking up objects.
The device is still a prototype, according to the company, but the as yet unnamed robo vac was on full display at Dreame’s CES booth. Considering it’s still a prototype, the actual arm looked far more substantial compared to the one on Roborock’s Saros Z70. It was much thicker and had a bigger “claw” that looked like it might be able to pick up slightly heavier objects. (Roborock says its vac can pick up object that weigh up to 300 grams.)&nbsp;
Plot Twist: Dreame also brought a robo vac with an retractable arm to CES pic.twitter.com/dLPGC135k5— Karissa Bell (@karissabe) January 8, 2025
 
Unfortunately, Dreame wasn’t showing it actually grab anything, but I was able to watch the arm extend and retract several times. It appeared to be on a similar device as the X50 as the prototype vacuum also rocked up onto “legs,” much like Dreame&#39;s stair-stepping X50.
A Dreame rep at the booth told me that the company has been working on the prototype for a while, but decided to accelerate its plans for the vacuum at CES. After a quick glance up, I knew exactly what he was referring to: Dreame’s booth is positioned directly across from Roborock, which was displaying a massive replica of its arm-wielding Saros Z70 on top of its booth.
Elsewhere on the show floor, SwitchBot was showing off the K20+ Pro, another robot vacuum with some unusual abilities. Though there were no robotic arms on display in its booth, a promotional video shared by the company shows a vacuum-mounted arm picking up trash and placing it in a wastebasket. So the company has at least considered the possibility.&nbsp;
Maybe next year we&#39;ll see the two robot vacuum arms wrestle.&nbsp;
Update January 8, 2025, 3 PM PT: This post has been updated to include details about SwitchBot&#39;s K20+ Pro.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/more-than-one-company-brought-a-robot-vacuum-with-a-mechanical-arm-to-ces-2025-014056459.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/more-than-one-company-brought-a-robot-vacuum-with-a-mechanical-arm-to-ces-2025-014056459.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 01:40:57 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
"At CES 2025 I toured the Haus.me microhaus Pro, a self-contained living pod you can put just about anywhere","We may no longer be at the height of the tiny home craze, but the idea of a resource-light, efficiently built home that can be plonked down just about anywhere still appeals. Today at CES, I got to tour the 2025 model of the microhaus Pro from California-based Haus.me. It was shiny, swankily appointed and, honestly, not as expensive as I thought it'd be.&nbsp; 
The interior of the 120-square foot unit is all wood tones, glass and soft neutrals. It's like you took a shipping container and replaced the hard lines and corrugated steel with rounded corners and floor-to-ceiling windows. The surfaces glint and every part of the space is maximized with an Ikea-like small-space efficiency, like the queen-sized Murphy bed that folds up to reveal a table and two bench seats. The kitchen has a small fridge, microwave and included in the price is a full suite of Villeroy &amp; Boch dishware and there's a full-sized shower in the bathroom.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The units truly can go just about anywhere with no site preparation required — if the ground is flat, it'll work. The microhaus Pro is also climate agnostic, with the ability to set up in snowy forests, hot deserts and temperate beaches (though hot and cold climate packages are about $10,00 extra each). It's also seismic California fire code and CAT-5 hurricane compliant.&nbsp;

Installation takes usually under an hour and doesn't require any special hook ups — a garden hose and an extension cord is all it needs. And thanks to its size, it falls below the size threshold that would require a permit. The included 3.6 kWh battery can run everything in the home for four days and there's an optional atmospheric water generation and a battery life of four days. Drinking water is reverse osmosis filtered and the waste disposal system ""melts"" everything into liquid, which can be run out an extendable pipe you can connect to septic or a holding tank.&nbsp; 
The Pro model also features high-end perks like voice control via the Apple HomePod mounted to the wall. During my tour, Max Gerbut, Haus.me's CEO asked Siri to lower the shades, and it complied. You also get the full package, dishes, towels et cetera — I even saw a drawer full of M&amp;Ms in the kitchen and was assured you get those too.&nbsp; 
The Pro model is a more deluxe and robust edition meant for Airbnb and rental use and goes for $89,99. If you don't need the smart home features, the battery backup and the included dishes, you can grab the microhaus Lite for $59,990. There's also a $35,000 shell version that includes just the HVAC system, lights, wiring, bathroom fixtures and plumbing.&nbsp; 
One thing none of the microhaus models include is solar generation. For that, you'll need to switch up to the 400 and 800 square-foot units. Those have the same put-it-anywhere convenience but are fully autonomous and go for $199,000 and $299,000, respectively. Note that none of the prices include delivery.&nbsp; 
It's true — none of these prices are small numbers. But I've helped build yurts, tiny homes and sheds. I've lived in more than one hand-built home and have looked into many other modular, pre-fab options. Comparatively, these prices aren't terribly high, especially when you consider there's nearly no site prep, no installation and no contractor required.&nbsp; 
The microhaus Pro is available to order now from the Haus.me website.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Dreame's X50 robot vacuum can climb stairs,"Robot vacuums can make cleaning up a lot more convenient but, depending on your home’s layout, might not work with every floorplan. Chinese appliance maker Dreame is hoping to address that with its X50 robot vacuum that’s able to climb over small stairs without assistance.
Though the robot vac has yet to launch in the US, it’s already generated some buzz thanks to a teaser posted on YouTube last year (the X50 is already available in China).  Now, the $1699 X50 is making its US debut at CES 2025, with Dreame offering an up-close look at its abilities.
Dreame’s X50 robot vacuum climbing up some (small stairs) at CES, the company says these vacs can can survive about 30,000 “actions” on average pic.twitter.com/3uMf10GkZW— Karissa Bell (@karissabe) January 8, 2025
 
Dreame says the X50 can handle stairs up to 6cm high (about 2.4 inches), thanks to its “ProLeap System,” which relies on a motorized arm underneath the vacuum that’s able to swing out and boost it over steps. So while the X50 won’t be able to climb up a full-size staircase (the average stair height in a home is between 7 and 8 inches, according to Google), it should be able to maneuver over smaller steps and other obstacles that may trip up other robot vacuums.
We watched it in action on the CES show floor and the X50 was indeed able to repeatedly maneuver up and down a set of small steps. And, for those who might be worries about the mechanical ""legs"" breaking, Dreame says the robo vac can hold up to about 30,000 ""actions"" on avergae.&nbsp;
In addition to its stair-climbing abilities, the X50 can maneuver underneath furniture and identify up to 200 types of objects, which helps it detect obstacles in its path. It also has a built-in hot water mop and a specialized brush to sweep up hair without becoming a tangled mess.
Dreame is opening pre-orders for the X50 on January 7, with people who pre-order also getting an extended two-year warranty and an extra cleaning kit. The vacuum officially goes on sale on Amazon and Dreame’s website on February 14.
Update, January 7, 2025, 5:00 PM PT: This post has been updated to add photos, video and additional information from Dreame.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/dreames-x50-robot-vacuum-can-climb-stairs-200058312.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/dreames-x50-robot-vacuum-can-climb-stairs-200058312.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 01:00:14 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
Sony Honda Mobility CES 2025 keynote: Learn more about the Afeela 1 EV live here,"The Afeela 1 is getting some quality time for itself today at CES. While it was a highlight of the Sony press conference on Monday night, it had to share the stage there with Sony&#39;s other priorities (which, oddly, were more about anime, TV and movies and professional video creation tools more than consumer electronics). Right now, it&#39;s got center stage at a dedicated event from Sony Honda Mobility, the joint venture between the two Japanese concerns behind the Afeela.
What to expect at Afeela&#39;s CES 2025 press conference
We know a lot more about the Afeela 1 than we did 24 hours ago, thanks to Sony&#39;s earlier presser. The Afeela 1 Origin and Afeela 1 Signature are priced at $89,900 and $109,900, respectively. Customers in California are now able to reserve a Signature trim for a refundable fee of $200 and the first deliveries are planned for mid-2026. The Origin variant is set to arrive the following year. Both variants factor in three years of access to services including Level 2+ driver assistance, the Afeela Personal Agent and a range of entertainment options.
At the Afeela keynote, we should learn much more about the Afeela 1. Expect a closer look at a near-final version of the EV, which is packed with tech.
Watch the Afeela CES 2025 livestream
You can watch the Afeela CES 2025 press conference live right here. The keynote started Tuesday, January 7 at 7:30PM ET.

Pebble Flow all-electric RV trailer will begin deliveries this spring,"Pebble unveiled the Pebble Flow all-electric RV trailer at last year's CES. At this year's show, they've finalized both design and price for the Pebble Flow. Pebble announced that the RV trailer will be go into production at the start of 2025, with deliveries of expected to begin in the spring of the year.
The final design of the trailer includes some new additions to what Pebble introduced in Las Vegas in 2024. The interior has been revised for improved access to cabinets, additional side and rear windows, a bigger door, and larger storage space. The Pebble Flow has also gotten some tweaks to the exterior and the drivetrain system has been re-engineered.
The Pebble Flow is equipped with a 45 kWh lithium iron phosphate battery and a 1.1 kW solar array. According to the company, this can support up to seven days on the road from solar recharging and regenerative braking.
The base model will cost $109,500. The Magic Pack upgrade option adds a dual-motor drivetrain that enables advanced automation features; this model costs $135,500. The Founders Edition model, with a limited-edition color and the complete set of available upgrades, will cost $175,000.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/pebble-flow-all-electric-rv-trailer-will-begin-deliveries-this-spring-003024921.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/pebble-flow-all-electric-rv-trailer-will-begin-deliveries-this-spring-003024921.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 00:30:24 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang welcomes the rise of superintelligent AI at CES 2025,"Surprising no one, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang isn&#39;t too worried about a future filled with robots and superintelligent AI. In fact, he welcomes it. During a CES Q&amp;A session with media and analysts, Huang was asked if he thought intelligent robots would ultimately side with humans, or against them. &quot;With the humans, because we&#39;re going to build them that way,&quot; he replied confidently.
&quot;The idea of superintelligence is not unusual,&quot; Huang continued. &quot;I have a company with many many people who are superintelligent in their field of work. I&#39;m surrounded by superintelligence. And I prefer to be surrounded by superintelligence than the alternative.&quot;
Given that the hype around generative AI has been huge for NVIDIA&#39;s business — it&#39;s currently vying with Apple and Microsoft for the largest valuation in the world — it makes sense that Huang would be all for a future where we&#39;re more reliant on smarter AI. He falls short of proclaiming the arrival of god-like artificial general intelligence (AGI) like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Tesla&#39;s Elon Musk, instead Huang&#39;s vision sounds more task-focused.&nbsp;
&quot;That&#39;s the future, you&#39;re going to have superintelligent AI that will let you write, analyze problems, deal with supply chain planning, write software, design chips,&quot; he said. &quot;The technology, of course, can be used in many ways, but it&#39;s humans that are harmful. I think machines are machines.&quot;
During the morning Q&amp;A session, which came after Huang&#39;s lengthy CES keynote to a mostly unenthusiastic crowd, he admitted that he did a poor job of conveying his vision for AI in the real world. Huang thinks the combination of NVIDIA&#39;s Omniverse technology for visualizing 3D routines, as well as NVIDIA Cosmos for generating photorealistic environments for AI training, will make it easier to train robots for real-world work. That could end up being one small step towards AI superintelligence — or, at the very least, slightly more capable robots.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-welcomes-the-rise-of-superintelligent-ai-at-ces-2025-002827074.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-welcomes-the-rise-of-superintelligent-ai-at-ces-2025-002827074.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 00:28:27 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
Jackery’s curved solar roof tiles are so normie even your HOA might like them,"Longstanding solar generator company Jackery is leveling up the US’ roof game with the introduction of XBC curved solar shingles. Debuting at CES 2025, Jackery’s curved solar roof tiles come in terracotta or obsidian, designed to match some of the most common house styles in the country. While solar shingles definitely already exist in the US, these are the first with a wavy aesthetic. It sounds like HOA presidents everywhere just lost one more excuse for preventing your rooftop solar installation.
Jackery
The new tiles deliver a cell conversion efficiency of more than 25 percent, and they’re built to withstand extreme weather conditions, including hail, high wind and temperatures between -40 degrees F and 185 degrees F. They’re designed in line with traditional roofing installation practices, featuring a modular setup that allows for flexible, piecemeal maintenance. Jackery provides a 30-year warranty on the tiles, too.
The Jackery Solar Roof system integrates with the company’s existing in-home solar solutions, including the HomePower Inverter, Battery, Hub and Hub Plus, and the Solar Generator 5000 Plus and Smart Transfer Switch Kit.
There’s no word on specific pricing or availability for the new tiles just yet, even though Jackery was highlighting them in a big way at CES 2025. Jackery, founded in Silicon Valley in 2012, is one of the leading names in portable generators and whole-home solar kits, a market that&#39;s becoming more accessible by the year.
Engadget
Also at this year&#39;s show, Jackery showed off its first Solar Generator RV Kit, the new 3000v2 backup generator, and its full-coverage HomePower Energy System.&nbsp;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/jackerys-curved-solar-roof-tiles-are-so-normie-even-your-hoa-might-like-them-000009034.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/jackerys-curved-solar-roof-tiles-are-so-normie-even-your-hoa-might-like-them-000009034.html?src=rss,"Wed, 08 Jan 2025 00:00:09 +0000",Sports,www.engadget.com
Linda Yaccarino on Meta ending fact-checking: ‘Welcome to the party’,"You probably didn’t have X CEO Linda Yaccarino praising Meta and Mark Zuckerberg on your CES 2025 bingo card, yet here we are. Speaking during a keynote address in Las Vegas, Yaccarino described Meta’s decision to end its longtime fact checking program and implement community notes as “exciting” and “validating.”
Yaccarino and and X owner Elon Musk have both championed the crowd-sourced fact-checking feature that Meta now plans to emulate on its own services. “I think it’s really exciting when you think about community notes being good for the world … and it couldn’t be more validating than to see that Mark and Meta realize that,” Yaccarino said. “Mark, Meta, welcome to the party.”
Meta and Zuckerberg may find themselves in dubious company at the “party,” however. While X often touts the number of users who contribute to Community Notes, some researchers have pointed out flaws in the feature. A report last year from misinformation researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) noted that many misleading posts, including prominent posts from Musk himself, can rack up billions of views without receiving a correction.
It’s not surprising at all that Yaccarino would praise Zuckerberg's move to cut ties with the media institutions that have been its longtime partners for fact-checking content on Facebook and Instagram. Like her boss Musk, she’s made no secret of her disdain for “legacy media,” and she spent a significant portion of her time onstage railing against “legacy news that is designed to make you think a certain way.”
Zuckerberg’s move to loosen its content moderation standards is the latest sign of just how far the Facebook founder is willing to go to realign himself with the political right as Donald Trump prepares to take office. He also added a prominent Trump backer, UFC CEO Dana White, to Meta’s board and elevated the company’s most prominent Republican executive to run global affairs.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/linda-yaccarino-on-meta-ending-fact-checking-welcome-to-the-party-231304753.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/social-media/linda-yaccarino-on-meta-ending-fact-checking-welcome-to-the-party-231304753.html?src=rss,"Tue, 07 Jan 2025 23:13:04 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
"Rictor’s Skyrider X1 is equal parts moped, quadcopter and fantasy","According to Wikipedia, the first instance of the phrase “post-truth” was written by Steve Teisch in 1992 when referencing political scandals post-Watergate. Clearly, ol’ Stevie never visited CES, where the standards for saying things that are provably true are slightly laxer than in the rest of civil discourse. Apropos of nothing, a company called Rictor, which makes and sells one e-bike, the Rictor K1, is advertising the Skyrider X1. A moped-cum-quadcopter that you can use to zoom through the streets one second, and through the skies another. Which, as you all know, is a totally achievable thing for any consumer electronics company to be able to achieve by its promised launch date of 2026.
The Skyrider X1, its theoretical makers claim, is an electric moped with an enclosed cabin that, when things get too congested, will transform into a quadcopter. All you’ll need to do is pop out the four arms, each with two fanblades, and you’ll be able to ascend up to a maximum of 200 meters above the ground. Rictor says safety is its top priority, including plenty of redundant systems and, should all else fail, a built-in parachute. Plus, the Skyrider X1 is capable of automatically taking off and landing, and can plan its optimal route when it’s up in the air. And on the company’s website, it says the X1 SL, with a 10.5kWh battery will have a flight time of 25 minutes, while the X1 SX, with its 21kWh battery, will stay in the air for 40 minutes.
That’s pretty exciting, not to mention the company says that it’s aiming to sell the Skyrider X1 for $60,000, far below what you might expect to pay for a mop-copter in this class.

Spit on this stick to see how burned out you are,"Stress can really take a toll on your body and mind, often in ways you may not immediately realize. Swiss startup Nutrix AG is hoping a quick, at-home spit test can help by giving users a better idea of how stressed out they really are — and tools to manage it. 
At CES 2025, Nutrix showed off its cortiSense device that’s designed to measure levels of cortisol in saliva and can be used to track changes over time. The startup aims to launch it by the end of this year, and it’ll work with the gSense app and digital platform to offer things like personalized wellness coaching from a medical team. 
It’s meant to be an easy and noninvasive way to identify and combat burnout. The part that’s a little sus, though? In a press release, Nutrix CEO Maria Hahn said the company is focusing on “empowering enterprises,"" noting that employee burnout can present “a significant challenge with a huge human and financial cost.” So, get your stress under control to better perform labor, I guess. 
I wasn’t able to pop one in my mouth and try it out (I did ask), but the Nutrix team says a reading should take about 3-5 minutes to complete. The device, which looks like a vape, uses disposable tabs that have a cortisol measuring sensor. “You get the quantitative information of the cortisol in saliva,” which is then “transmitted over to the digital health platform to combine with other data, like activity monitoring, glucose [and] weight,” said Nutrix co-founder and CTO Dr. Jemish Parmar at CES’s Unveiled event. You’re supposed to take four measurements a day.

The company didn’t share pricing information, but the team says it will be offered as part of a subscription program that would include the cortiSense device, the single-use sensors and the digital health platform. The gSense platform so far offers guidance around weight loss, but it will soon offer mental health services too, according to Dr. Dominika Sulot, the Data and Software Lead. “Once you have all the data, you’re scheduling an appointment with [the medical team] and then they’re providing you the personalized plan,” Sulot says. 
For personal use, this kind of thing could be great if it works as stated, especially if it would connect users with physical and mental health support. But I'm not loving the emphasis on enterprise applications to, per the press release, “foster a healthier, more productive workforce.” Actually, I might have just vomited in my mouth a little writing that. I wonder what cortiSense would detect in that.&nbsp;

CES 2025: The Lenovo Legion Go S is the first third-party SteamOS handheld,"The Lenovo Legion Go is sort of like the SUV of gaming handhelds. It’s big, beefy, comes with a lot of extra equipment like detachable controllers and it supports vertical mouse functionality that lets it adapt to all sorts of situations. All of that versatility is great, but it makes the device kind of bulky. But for CES 2025, Lenovo is announcing a slightly more portable version called the Legion Go S with support for not one but two different OSes: Windows 11 and SteamOS.
That said, the specs on both variants are nearly identical. They feature either an AMD Ryzen Z2 Go chip or the Z1 Extreme APU Lenovo used on the previous model, with up to 32GB of RAM, 1TB SSD and a 55.5Wh battery. You also get a microSD card slot for expandable storage, two USB 4 ports and a 3.5mm audio jack. The main difference is their color (and release date, but more on that later) as the Windows 11 Legion Go S comes in white while the SteamOS model will be available in black.
Compared to the original Legion Go, the S features a smaller but still large 8-inch 120 Hz OLED display (down from 8.8 inches) with a 1,920 x 1,200 resolution and VRR instead of 2,560 x 1,600 144Hz panel like on the original. It also doesn’t have detachable controllers or a kickstand. The benefit of this is that the whole system feels much sturdier, which should make you feel better about tossing it in a bag before your next trip. It’s also noticeably lighter at 1.6 pounds versus 1.9 for its older sibling.
Notably, you still get analog sticks with Hall Effect sensors, which you don’t get on rivals like ASUS’ pricey ROG Ally X. Lenovo also moved to a new pivot-style D-pad, though I’m not sure that counts as a true upgrade as I tend to prefer the classic cross-style ones. Another nice bonus for tinkerers is that on the inside, the Go S comes with a shorter 2242 SSD module even though it can accommodate desktop-size 2280 sticks.
Initially, I got a chance to check out the Windows 11 version, whose performance felt quite snappy thanks to the drop in resolution to 1,920 x 1,200, which feels like a more suitable match for its components. Lenovo has also made some improvements to its Legion Space app, so it functions much better as a general game launch and a place to tweak performance and settings. I also appreciate little touches like how even though it&#39;s much smaller, the Legion Go S still has a touchpad in front, which is such a huge help when you need to exit Legion Space and navigate around in Windows. I’d even say that despite its size, the pad on the Go S is more responsive, as it feels more like a trackball than a tiny touchpad.  And around back, there’s a small toggle for adjusting how far you can pull the shoulder buttons.
As for the Legion Go S powered by SteamOS, I found it remarkable how similar it felt to the Steam Deck despite not being made by Valve. The UI is almost identical, the only differences are some subtle tweaks Lenovo added to support things like the handheld’s RGB lighting and higher 30-watt TDP. In person, the SteamOS models’ casing looks more like a dark purple than pure black, which is a nice subtle touch. However my biggest takeaways is that Valve’s OS felt slightly more responsive that it does on the Steam Deck, which I’m attributing to the Legion’s newer APU.
The small hiccup is that a higher-end version of Legion Go S running Windows 11 is expected to go on sale first sometime later this month starting at $730 with an AMD Z2 Go processor, 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. Unfortunately, that means anyone who wants one of the more affordable models with 16GB of RAM or running SteamOS will have to wait a bit longer, as those variants won’t be available until May. On the bright side, the Legion Go S powered by SteamOS will have a lower starting price of $499 compared to an equivalent Windows model which will start at $599.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/ces-2025-the-lenovo-legion-go-s-is-the-first-third-party-steamos-handheld-160001642.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/ces-2025-the-lenovo-legion-go-s-is-the-first-third-party-steamos-handheld-160001642.html?src=rss,"Tue, 07 Jan 2025 21:43:13 +0000",Sports,www.engadget.com
Everything NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang announced at its CES 2025 keynote,"NVIDIA held its CES 2025 keynote last night with CEO Jensen Huang and it was surprisingly eventful. The company finally unveiled its much awaited GeForce RTX 5000 GPUs that promise a considerable performance uplift, to start with. The company didn&#39;t stop there, also announcing Project Digits, a personal AI supercomputer, along with DLSS 4 and more. Here&#39;s a wrap-up of what happened — and you can watch the whole event uncut, via the YouTube embed below. (Spoiler alert: It&#39;s more than 90 minutes long.)
NVIDIA RTX 5000-series GPUs
Huang strode out in a new snakeskin-like leather jacket and revealed the much-anticipated RTX 5090 GPU. With 32GB of GDDR7 RAM and an impressive 21,760 CUDA cores, the new flagship can deliver up to twice as much relative performance, particularly for ray-tracing (RT) intensive games like Cyberpunk 2077. In fact that particular title ran at 234 fps with full RT on in a video demo, compared to 109 fps on the RTX 4090. It&#39;s not cheap, though, priced at $1,999.&nbsp;
The company also revealed the $549 RTX 5070 with a far more modest 6,144 CUDA cores and 12GB of DDR7 RAM, along with the $749 RTX 5070 Ti and $999 RTX 5080.&nbsp;
DLSS 4
A key part of the RTX 5000-series launch was the introduction of DLSS 4, the latest version of the company&#39;s real-time image upscaling technology. It features a new technology called Multi Frame Generation that allows the new GPUs to generate up to three additional frames for every one frame the GPU produces via traditional rendering — helping multiply frame rates by up to eight times. It also represents what NVIDIA calls the &quot;biggest upgrade to its AI models&quot; since DLSS 2, improving things like temporal stability and detail, while reducing artifacts like ghosting.&nbsp;
Project Digits&nbsp;
Finally, NVIDIA launched Project Digits, a &quot;personal AI supercomputer&quot; designed for AI researchers, data scientists and students. It uses NVIDIA&#39;s new GB10 Grace Blackwell superchip, providing up to a petaflop of performance for testing and running AI models. The company says a single Project Digits unit can run models 200 billion parameters in size, or multiple machines can be linked together to run up to 405 billion parameter models. And for its intended audience, Project Digits is relatively cheap at $3,000.
On top of all that, the company introduced  NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models for robot and AV development, the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion AV platform for autonomous vehicles and AI Foundation models for RTX PCs &quot;that supercharge digital humans.&quot; It&#39;s all explained in the video above and NVIDIA&#39;s CES 2025 keynote blog.&nbsp;
NVDA stock price seesaw
CES — and Huang&#39;s keynote — are happening against the backdrop of continued volatility in the company&#39;s stock price. NVIDIA shares (ticker NVDA) spiked ahead of Huang&#39;s address, closing on Monday just shy of Apple&#39;s market cap pinnacle. But Tuesday saw a reversal, with the stock down more than 6 percent. Still, some are betting it&#39;s a toss up between the two tech giants as to which will hit the $4 trillion market valuation first.
Update, January 7 2025, 4:18PM ET: This story has been updated with new details on Nvidia&#39;s stock price.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/everything-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-announced-at-its-ces-2025-keynote-174947827.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/ai/everything-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-announced-at-its-ces-2025-keynote-174947827.html?src=rss,"Tue, 07 Jan 2025 21:18:11 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
"Engadget review recap: Samsung's Galaxy S25 phones, OnePlus 13 and Oura Ring 4","We may bit a post-CES news lull some days, but the reviews are coming in hot and heavy as February begins. Samsung has already debuted its latest premium phones and we've published a few long-term reviews of devices we've been testing for months. In this installment of the reviews roundup, we've got phones, a wearable, a robot vacuum and a smart grill. There's something for everyone this week.&nbsp; 
Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 
  
Samsung has given us the first flagship phones of 2025 and they rely heavily on AI features to lure users. Sam notes that the company has improved those tools, but the Galaxy S25 Ultra feels like an iterative update due to the limited hardware upgrades. ""This means a lot of what Samsung focused on in this generation feels more like a bonus rather than a must-have feature,"" he writes. ""And when you can get around 90 percent of the phone’s capabilities from previous models, the most dangerous thing Samsung is asking buyers to consider is why they need to upgrade at all."" 
Samsung Galaxy S25 
  
Like the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Samsung leaned heavily into the AI features on the regular S25. However, the company didn't spend a lot of time updating the design and major components of this model either. As Mat explains, this makes for a boring release for the long-running flagship line. ""Unless you’re desperate for a bump in processing power and battery life, it would be wise to see how heavily last year’s models get discounted in the coming months,"" he says.&nbsp; 
Anker Eufy E20 
  
The Eufy E20 is a first-of-its-kind transforming robot vacuum. While it works best in its core function as a robo vac, you do have the option of cordless stick and handheld vac configurations in the same device. ""While Eufy isn’t a stranger to making solid robot vacuums, this device is still a first-gen product in my mind — and a solid one at that,"" Valentina notes. ""But you have to know what you’re buying upfront: an above-average robot vacuum that can turn into a just-average stick and hand vacuum."" 
Oura Ring 4 
  
Smart rings may still be niche, but there's one company that stands above the rest. With the Ring 4, Oura fixed flaws of the previous model to ensure its crown is safe for the time being. ""If there’s a downside, it’s that Oura remains forever constrained by the limitations a smart ring imposes,"" Dan explains. ""If you want something more comprehensive, then it’s likely a smartwatch is a better option, but for everything else, there’s this."" 
OnePlus 13 
  
While most phone companies are focused on AI features, OnePlus decided to build a compelling, flagship-level handset that isn't overloaded with bloat. ""Throughout the years, OnePlus has used taglines like 'flagship killer' and 'ultra in every way' as a means of taking shots at its biggest rivals from Samsung, Google and more,"" Sam writes. ""But for the OnePlus 13, it feels like the company just went and made a really solid premium handset without a bunch of AI fluff."" 
Weber Searwood 
  
Weber's first pellet grill, the SmokeFire, was a learning experience for the company. Thankfully, the longstanding brand learned from those missteps when it built the Searwood. The company's second smart pellet grill offers more reliable performance, excelling at low-and-slow smoking. Weber opted for an all-new design for this model, from the cooking area to the new display. There's also a manual mode that allows for open-lid griddling and searing. And while there are some caveats, the Searwood is a much-improved grill compared to its predecessor.&nbsp; 
Upcoming reviews: Apple, Beats, Technics and more 
According to Bloomberg, Apple will debut a new iPhone SE next week. This will be the first update to that model since 2022, and will reportedly nix the home button. The report also details specifics like a camera notch, USB-C and the use of Apple's first in-house cellular modem. If the timing holds true, we'll expect to begin our testing shortly after the news drops.&nbsp; 
In that same report, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman explains that Beats' PowerBeats Pro 2 earbuds are expected to debut next week as well. The Apple-owned brand first teased an update to its fitness-focused model with a over-the-ear hook design last September. Gurman reports that the new model will have heart rate monitoring, which will be a first for a set of Apple earbuds. If the PowerBeats Pro 2 are indeed announced soon, we'll expect to have a review ready shortly after.&nbsp; 
I've got the Technics EAH-AZ100 earbuds in for testing too. These buds won one of Engadget's Best of CES awards last month and I've been eager to get my hands... er, ears... on them ever since. During a brief hands-on in Las Vegas, the company's newly designed Magnetic Fluid drivers offered impressive sound, but I'm looking forward to seeing how this set holds up during a full gamut of tests.&nbsp;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-samsungs-galaxy-s25-phones-oneplus-13-and-oura-ring-4-180039298.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-samsungs-galaxy-s25-phones-oneplus-13-and-oura-ring-4-180039298.html?src=rss,"Sat, 08 Feb 2025 18:00:39 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
2025 is going to be another big year for commercial moon missions,"As soon as late February, a lunar lander will depart from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center on its way to the moon carrying instruments that could investigate what’s just beneath the surface. Barely two months into the year, it’ll be the third mission to have set out on a journey toward the moon so far in 2025. If 2024 was all about establishing a commercial presence on the moon, 2025 is the year of doubling down. Well, unless Trump decides to deprioritize moon missions and shift the focus to Mars under Elon Musk’s direction, throwing off the whole timeline. But as it stands, it should be a busy year for the moon.
Last year kicked off with the launch of Astrobotics’ Peregrine lander, marking the first of several missions led by companies working under multimillion-dollar contracts as part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. Peregrine ultimately didn’t make it to its destination after suffering a propellant leak post-launch, but only a few weeks later, Intuitive Machines launched and successfully landed its Odysseus spacecraft on the moon — a first for a private spacecraft. (Odysseus tipped over when it hit the ground, but its payloads were still able to collect and transmit some data).
Now, fast-forward to this year, and NASA has half a dozen CLPS missions on its schedule. The first of these, Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost Mission 1, launched on January 15 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. That same rocket also carried a lunar lander made by the Japanese company ispace, which is making a second attempt for its own commercial exploration endeavor, Hakuto-R.
Firefly’s lander, Blue Ghost, is expected to arrive at the moon first, with a target landing date of March 2 in an area called Mare Crisium. The 6.6-foot-tall solar-powered spacecraft is carrying 10 science payloads for NASA and other partners. That includes a new dust shield system to demonstrate how future missions might prevent particulates from accumulating on spacecraft, instruments for testing sample collection and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based navigation and a radiation tolerant computer. “The objectives of the mission are to investigate heat flow from the lunar interior, plume-surface interactions, [and] crustal electric and magnetic fields,” according to NASA. “It will also take X-ray images of the Earth's magnetosphere.”
Resilience, the ispace lander, is taking a different, low-energy path to the moon and won’t reach its site, Mare Frigoris, until late May or June. That craft has a micro rover called Tenacious on board that is designed to explore, collect surface material and relay data. In addition to a camera and shovel, Tenacious has a tiny model house mounted on it — specifically the “Moonhouse,” by Swedish artist Mikael Genberg. The lander is carrying water electrolyzer equipment, a deep space radiation probe and a food production experiment module. (And how could we forget, it also contains a commemorative alloy plate from Bandai Namco Research Institute made in the style of the Gundam franchise’s “Charter of the Universal Century”).
ispace
Intuitive Machines, the company that pulled off the first-ever commercial moon landing with its Odysseus craft last year, is slated to launch its second CLPS mission in the next month or so, around the end of February. The IM-2 Nova-C lander dubbed Athena is headed to the lunar south pole with a meter-long drill and a mass spectrometer for NASA’s Polar Resources Ice Mining Experiment-1 (PRIME-1). Its goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of drilling for samples and analyzing those samples on-site for things like water. IM-2 will also serve as a rideshare for NASA’s Lunar Trailblazer, a small orbiter that will “study the form, abundance and distribution of lunar water and its relation to geology.”
Besides the PRIME-1 instruments, Athena will transport a laser retroreflector array, an Intuitive Machines Micro-Nova Hopper — described as “a propulsive drone that deploys off of a Nova-C lander and hops across the lunar surface” — and a Lunar Surface Communication System “network in a box” made by Nokia. The two companies plan to set up the moon’s first cellular network, which is “engineered to handle surface connectivity between the lander and vehicles, carrying high-definition video streaming, command-and-control communications and telemetry data.”
Intuitive Machines
There’s a chance Blue Origin’s Blue Moon Mark 1 lunar lander will take its first trip to the moon as soon as this spring or summer. John Couluris, a senior VP at Blue Origin, said in an interview with 60 Minutes last March that “we’re expecting to land on the moon between 12 and 16 months from today.” At the time, the company hadn’t yet launched its New Glenn rocket — which would be the vehicle for this mission — even once, so that claim didn’t hold much weight. But after many, many delays, New Glenn finally took its maiden flight in mid-January.
NASA revealed, in an FCC filing spotted by SpaceNews back in August, that it had selected Blue Origin’s lander to bring a camera system, the Stereo Cameras for Lunar Plume Surface Studies (SCALPSS), to the moon’s south pole this year under the CLPS program. In the filing, NASA notes that this needs to be done before 2025 is over, as the data collected by the instrument at landing will help inform plans for the first crewed Artemis moon landing. SCALPSS payloads have flown on other CLPS missions, but the thrust level of Blue Origin’s Mark 1 lander is closer to the scale of the Human Landing System NASA will use for astronauts.
Blue Origin said in another FCC filing the same month that its demonstration lunar mission, Pathfinder, could launch as early as March 2025, SpaceNews reported. Don’t be surprised if it actually happens much later.
The next CLPS mission after that isn’t expected to take off until the fall, when Astrobotic will get another shot at landing on the moon. This time, it’ll be sending its larger Griffin lander to a region near the south pole. Griffin Mission 1 was initially supposed to carry NASA’s Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER), but the space agency canceled development of that project late last year due to delays and rising costs. Astrobotic’s lander won’t show up to the moon empty-handed, though. It’ll have a tiny solar-powered CubeRover in tow, as well as a laser retroreflector array to pinpoint the lander’s location.
Astrobotic
We may see a third Intuitive Machines mission before the end of this year. The company and NASA are eyeing late 2025 or early 2026 for the launch of IM-3, which will deliver a suite of instruments focused on studying the magnetic and plasma properties of the Reiner Gamma lunar swirl, an area with its own “mini-magnetosphere.” A rover called the Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform (MAPP) will also be on board, plus a trio of small rovers from the Cooperative Autonomous Distributed Robotic Exploration (CADRE) project that will demonstrate mostly autonomous robots working together. The European Space Agency’s MoonLIGHT laser retroreflector will fly with IM-3 too, along with and the Lunar Space Environment Monitor, from South Korea’s Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI).
While this year is certain to bring a lot of activity on and around the moon, there’s one thing we won’t see there just yet — humans. NASA has adjusted the timeline of the Artemis missions a few times since the program’s announcement, and most recently said in December that it’s pushing the first crewed flight, Artemis II, to April 2026. The agency previously said it was shooting for September 2025. Artemis III, the mission in which two astronauts will go to the lunar surface, now isn’t expected to launch until mid-2027.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/2025-is-going-to-be-another-big-year-for-commercial-moon-missions-160038622.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/science/space/2025-is-going-to-be-another-big-year-for-commercial-moon-missions-160038622.html?src=rss,"Sat, 08 Feb 2025 16:00:38 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
TikTok advises Android users in the US to sideload the app,"If you need to download and install TikTok in the US, you can do so on Android even though the app isn&#39;t back on the Play Store yet. In a tweet, the TikTok Policy account has announced that the service has made Android Package Kits available for download through its official web site. Companies don&#39;t typically endorse sideloading, but Tiktok is, of course, a special case.&nbsp;
The app briefly went offline on January 19 before a law banning it in the US — unless its parent company ByteDance sells it to an owner based in the country — took effect. Under that law, the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store are required to remove its listing if they don&#39;t want to get slapped with a fine amounting to $5,000 for every user in the US who downloads the app. It didn&#39;t take a full day before TikTok restored access to its service, but its app has yet to reappear on Google&#39;s and Apple&#39;s stores in the US.
We&#39;re enhancing ways for our community to continue using TikTok by making Android Package Kits available at https://t.co/JoNVqKpnrS so that our U.S. Android users can download our app and create, discover, and connect on TikTok.More information at our Help Center:…— TikTok Policy (@TikTokPolicy) February 8, 2025
 
One of the executive orders President Donald Trump signed when he took office put a 75-day pause on the law that banned the app, giving ByteDance until April to reach a deal. Trump has reportedly put Vice President J.D. Vance in charge of negotiating a potential sale before the deadline. ByteDance repeatedly said in the past that it had no plans to sell the social media app, but one of the company&#39;s biggest investors recently said that a deal is in &quot;everybody&#39;s interest.&quot; Several companies and individuals have already expressed their intention to purchase TikTok in the US, including Perplexity AI and MrBeast.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/tiktok-advises-android-users-in-the-us-to-sideload-the-app-130015055.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/apps/tiktok-advises-android-users-in-the-us-to-sideload-the-app-130015055.html?src=rss,"Sat, 08 Feb 2025 13:00:15 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
The PlayStation Network is down,"The PlayStation Network is experiencing issues right now. Its network status page was updated at 7PM Eastern time with a warning that you may not be able to log in, access and edit your accounts, no matter what console you use. We&#39;re also unable to log into the network on our computer or our phone. &quot;We&#39;re working to resolve the issue as soon as possible,&quot; the notice reads. &quot;Thank you for your patience.&quot; It&#39;s not possible to create an account at the moment. The service has also warned that you may &quot;have difficulty&quot; firing up games and apps on your consoles and the web, so you may not be able to play some titles or access certain features that need an internet connection.&nbsp;
The network outage, unsurprisingly, affects the PlayStation Store. You&#39;ll have to do your shopping another time — you can&#39;t purchase and redeem vouchers, and you won&#39;t even be able to browse titles and search for specific ones. You can&#39;t start downloading new games and updates either, and if you were downloading anything before the issue began, it may not show any progress until the issue is fixed.&nbsp;

The weekend has started, and before it's over, we'll have a new NFL champion — but will it be the Kansas City Chiefs with an unprecedented third win in a row, or the Philadelphia Eagles? If that roster sounds familiar, it's because it's a rematch of the 2023 Super Bowl, where the Chiefs edged out the Eagles 38-35. The NFC champion Eagles are hungry for revenge, but the defending champion Chiefs are looking to make history.&nbsp; 
The kickoff for Super Bowl LIX will be this Sunday, February 9 at 6:30PM ET at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, LA — the eighth time the venue has hosted the big game. The 2025 Super Bowl Halftime Show will feature Kendrick Lamar, riding high on the five new Grammys he snagged just last Sunday, as well as SZA. Will Taylor Swift be there to cheer on beau Travis Kelce? The odds are currently yes. But she'll likely be splitting camera time with President Trump, who is also slated to attend the game in person.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Beyond that, you can also sign up for free trials of DirecTV Stream, Fubo, YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, each of which carry Fox in most locations. Two important caveats: Verify that your locality includes a Fox stream by inputting your ZIP code on their respective sites. And if you don't want to pay, make sure you cancel before the trial subscription ends — they can be as short as three days, so plan ahead. 
  
How to watch the 2025 Super Bowl without cable 
The Tubi option above is the easiest go-to starting point for free Super Bowl streaming — but no one knows how the service will hold up under what's certain to be its most intensive influx of concurrent users. There are plenty of worthwhile backups, each of which offer more comprehensive options for cordcutters beyond the game itself — say, watching SportsCenter on ESPN before or after the game. And most of our picks for best live TV streaming services offer free trials, so you can check them out risk-free. If you time it right, your free trial can include the Super Bowl broadcast, too.&nbsp;

Thanks to the wide array of streaming options detailed above, you'll be able to watch the Super Bowl on nearly any current device with a screen. There are plenty of Super Bowl TV deals ahead of the game if you need to upgrade that aging 40-inch screen with the dead pixels in the corner. Live close to a broadcast tower of a Fox station? Attach a good old-fashioned over-the-air antenna (like the Channel Master linked above), and you can get the game for free.&nbsp;

House Democrats press Mark Zuckerberg on Meta’s policy changes,"A group of House Democrats are pushing Mark Zuckerberg on Meta’s recent policy changes, saying they are “deeply concerned” about the company’s move to loosen its content moderation rules, end corporate diversity programs and ditch third-party fact checking. In a letter addressed to the Meta CEO, four members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee demanded details about the sweeping changes Zuckerberg announced last month.
“These policy changes, the timing of which gives the inescapable appearance of currying favor with the Trump Administration, are abhorrent, inconsistent, and dangerous,” the lawmakers wrote.
Meta so far hasn’t provided many specifics about how it will implement its new policies, which were announced shortly before President Donald Trump took office. The letter asks Zuckerberg to describe how Trump’s “threats of retribution against you” may have influenced the decision to end fact-checking on the platform. It also asks if the Facebook founder has “had discussions with anyone representing the Trump Administration regarding the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust case against Meta.”
The letter further notes that Zuckerberg’s recent statements seem to directly contradict previous remarks he made when the Oversight Board was first created. “The Oversight Board, once touted as a beacon of accountability, is rendered toothless when Meta itself refuses to adhere to the principles of ‘trust and safety,’” it says.
Lawmakers also questioned Zuckerberg about his public statements that corporations need more ""masculine energy” calling it “particularly strange in light of the fact that Meta’s long time Chief Legal Officer and its current Chief Financial Officer are both women and the three most important committees of your Board of Directors are chaired by women.”
Zuckerberg was given a February 21, 2025, deadline to respond. “We don’t have anything further to say beyond all we’ve already communicated over the last weeks,” a Meta spokesperson told Engadget when asked about the letter.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/house-democrats-press-mark-zuckerberg-on-metas-policy-changes-235229672.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/social-media/house-democrats-press-mark-zuckerberg-on-metas-policy-changes-235229672.html?src=rss,"Fri, 07 Feb 2025 23:52:29 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
Trump administration stops nationwide EV charging program,"The Trump administration has ordered states to stop a program to build fast EV chargers on highways throughout the country, according to a memo released by the Federal Highway Administration. The letter informs state transportation directors, who are in charge of instituting the program, that any plans approved by the Biden administration are now suspended “until new guidance is issued.”
The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program was approved by Congress as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. It was intended to fill gaps in America’s EV charging network and was supported by $5 billion in grants. President Trump has long decried the program and regularly lied about the specifics during the 2024 campaign.
The infrastructure law authorized $5B over 5 years for NEVI, a program that funds states to build fast EV charging stations. Buttigieg &amp; DOE ensured this program set high quality standards.So far, 50 stations (green) are now open &amp; 903 (purple) are underway⬇️#HappyBirthdayPete pic.twitter.com/KlgXMkMYKN— Nerdy Pursuit 🐉 (@nerdypursuit) January 20, 2025
 
To that end, Trump would often suggest that the Biden administration spent $9 billion to build eight EV charging stations. Sometimes he would lower the figure to just eight chargers. In reality, 55 charging stations have been built so far, according to data provided by The Washington Post. Just over $2 billion has been allocated to states, and much of it hasn’t been spent yet.
The mandate, as outlined in the new memo, will fulfill the financial obligations of NEVI, so long as a state already has a finalized contract with a charging company. Any unfinished contracts will likely be put on indefinite hold.
Can an organization like the FHA unilaterally put the kibosh on a program that was approved by Congress? The legality here is unclear, but Loren McDonald, chief analyst at the EV charging analytics firm Paren, said “I don’t believe FHWA has the authority to do this.”
Ryan Gallentine, managing director at the national business association Advanced Energy United, said that states “are under no obligation to stop these projects based solely on this announcement.” He went on to call on state leaders “to continue executing this program until new guidance is finalized.”
This move is also expected to be challenged in court. “I’m assuming the lawsuits from states will start soon, and this will go to court and Congress,” McDonald said. “But the Trump administration will succeed in just causing havoc and slowing things down for a while.”
Trump has been chipping away at EV policies since his first day in office. He issued an executive order that eliminated Biden’s target to transition half of the country’s vehicles to EVs by 2030. It’s expected that he will soon go after the federal tax credit for electric vehicles.
But won’t this hurt Trump’s bestie Elon Musk? Tesla, after all, was one of the largest recipients of those NEVI grants. It’s worth remembering that this mandate doesn’t rollback any contracts that have already been finalized. In other words, Musk is probably perfectly happy with the $31 million his company already snagged from the government. He has also long-approved of the proposed elimination of the federal tax credit, likely because it would harm competitors much more than Tesla.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/trump-administration-stops-nationwide-ev-charging-program-172002768.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/trump-administration-stops-nationwide-ev-charging-program-172002768.html?src=rss,"Fri, 07 Feb 2025 17:20:02 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
"The Apple AirPods 4 hit an all-time low of $100, plus the rest of the week's best tech deals","The latest edition of our weekly deal roundup includes a range of discounts on Apple's AirPods. The standard AirPods 4 are down to $100, which ties their lowest price to date, while ANC version of those earbuds and the higher-end AirPods Pro 2 are cheaper than usual at $149 and $169, respectively. If you don't need new headphones, we're also seeing discounts on Peacock and Apple Music subscriptions, our favorite robot vacuum and microSD card for those on a budget, Sonos speakers and more. Here are the best tech deals from this week that you can still get today.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Spotlight deal 
  
The rest of the best tech deals this week 
 
 Apple AirPods Pro 2 for $169 at Amazon ($80 off MSRP): If you're willing to pay extra and don't mind a traditional in-ear design, the AirPods Pro 2 are still the best wireless earphones Apple makes and our favorite pair for iPhone owners overall. They have the same set of Apple-friendly features noted above, but add stronger ANC, a more secure fit, fuller sound (thanks to that in-ear design), an hour or two of extra battery life and onboard volume controls. As of last fall, they can also function as an FDA-approved hearing aid. That said, if you aren't tethered to the Apple ecosystem, there are other pairs with superior noise cancellation, battery life and audio quality out there. This discount is $15 more than the all-time low we saw around Black Friday, but it's a good $20 to $30 below the pair's typical street price and $80 less than buying from Apple directly. Also at Walmart, Target and Best Buy. 
 Peacock Premium (1-year) for $30 at Peacock ($50 off, new and returning users only): New and returning subscribers can grab a year of Peacock's ad-supported plan for $30 through Feburary 18. (Yes, it's called ""Premium"" even though it has ads.) If you're not a current subscriber and don't see the discount, use the code WINTERSAVINGS at checkout. NBCUniversal ran a similar offer around Black Friday that dropped the subscription to $20, but this is still $50 off the annual plan's usual price. While we wouldn't call Peacock essential, it should be worth checking out if you're big into Premier League soccer, WWE live events or most shows from NBC and Bravo — The Office and Law and Order included. 
 
 
 
  The Samsung Evo Select. (The 1TB model is on sale today, not the 512GB model pictured here.)

 Samsung Evo Select (1TB) microSD card for $70 at Amazon ($10 off): The Evo Select is the budget pick in our guide to the best microSD cards: It's certainly not the fastest model we've tested, but it's quick enough if you just want to boost the storage of a Nintendo Switch or Android tablet on the cheap without feeling totally bogged down. Just don't expect it to be all that great for large file transfers. This deal matches the all-time low for the extra-spacious 1TB model. Also at Samsung and B&amp;H. 
 Sonos Era 100 for $199 at Sonos ($50 off): To address the elephant in the room, no, Sonos is not doing well right now. A redesign of the company's control app last May has been a colossal failure, eventually leading to the departure of the audio brand's CEO and chief product officer last month and sizable layoffs just this week. It's hard to get jazzed about discounts with all of that in mind, but this is a deal roundup, and we still do recommend much of firm's audio gear in our various buying guides, so we're obligated to mention that the company is still running a sale on its soundbars and home speakers through February 9. One highlight is the Sonos Era 100 for $199, a $50 discount that ties the lowest price we've seen. This is the top midrange pick in our guide to the best smart speakers: While the software situation is still iffy, the hardware still delivers impressively clean and balanced sound for its size. If you just want a single speaker for enjoying music at home, it remains a decent value at less than $200. Also at Amazon, Walmart, B&amp;H and others.

 $100 Apple Gift Card + $10 Best Buy Gift Card for $100 at Best Buy ($10 off): If you buy a $100 Apple gift card at Best Buy, the retailer will throw in a bonus $10 gift card to its own store for no extra cost. Both cards will be emailed to you digitally. For the unfamiliar, you can apply an Apple gift card to just about anything Apple makes, be it a new iPhone, an Apple TV+ subscription or purchases on the App Store. If you're looking to grab something along those lines and know you'll shop at Best Buy again anyway, it's hard to complain about a bit of bonus money.&nbsp; 
 Apple Music (6-month) for $3 at Apple ($52 off, new subscribers and select devices only): Speaking of Apple services, the company is running a promotion that doles out six months of Apple Music for $3 total. Normally, a solo subscription costs $11 per month after a 30-day free trial, or a three-month trial if you've recently bought an Apple device. This newest promo comes with a few caveats, though: You must be new to Apple Music, not eligible for the aforementioned three-month trial and able to redeem the offer through an iPhone, iPad or Mac. If you meet all of that criteria, however, this is a nice way to get a half-year of music streaming for cheap. We praise Apple Music in our guide to the best music streaming services for its lossless streaming quality, ease of use with Apple devices and emphasis on letting actual people introduce you to new music. Apple says this deal will run through February 27. Just be aware that your subscription will be set to auto-renew until you cancel. 
 
 
 
  The iRobot Roomba Vac Essential.
 
 
  iRobot
 
 
 
 iRobot Roomba Vac Essential (Q0120) for $130 at Amazon ($120 off): The Roomba Vac Essential is the top pick in our guide to the best budget robot vacuums. It's a basic entry-level model, as it navigates semi-randomly instead of mapping set paths and will still bonk into furniture every now and then. But it cleans well enough, especially on hard floors, and we've found it easy to set up and control through Roomba's mobile app. If you're on a budget and live in a smaller place that isn't inundated with pet hair, you could do much worse. This discount is the lowest price we've tracked and a $20 drop from the robovac's typical going rate in recent months. Also at Best Buy, Target and others. 
 Anker 713 USB-C Charger for $20 at Amazon ($20 off): The Anker 713 Charger is a compact wall charger with one USB-C port that can deliver up to 45W of power. It's not the newest or fastest model out there, but it's easy to tuck in a bag and powerful enough to charge many modern smartphones and tablets at full speed. This discount matches the lowest price we've seen and takes about $8 off the device's common street price. Also at Anker. If you need something faster with a couple more ports, the 67W Anker Prime charger is also on sale for a low of $36. 
 
 
 
  The Razer Viper V3 Pro.

 Razer Viper V3 Pro for $145 at Amazon ($15 off): It's not a massive discount, but this $15 drop marks the lowest price we've seen for the Viper V3 Pro, which tops our guide to the best gaming mice. This is very much a niche device, aimed squarely at those who take competitive PC games seriously, but its 54-gram design is super lightweight, consistently responsive and comfortable for a wide range of grip types and hand sizes. Just don't expect it to keep you from getting owned in Counter-Strike 2 or Marvel Rivals on its own. Also at Best Buy. 
 LG B4 OLED TV (48"") for $600 at Best Buy ($200 off): This ties the lowest price we've seen for the 48-inch LG B4, which is the entry-level model in LG's 2024 OLED lineup. While it's not as bright or color-rich as some higher-end alternatives, it still offers the essential perks of any good OLED TV: superb contrast with deep black tones, clear motion, wide viewing angles and the like. It's also a nice value for gaming, as it has four HDMI 2.1 ports that support refresh rates up to 120Hz. It's just better off in a darker room, and this particular model is relatively small. If you're curious about what other TV deals are available ahead of the Super Bowl, note that we have a separate roundup just for those.

Sonos speakers and soundbars are on sale for record-low prices,"It may be too late to get new gear in time for the Super Bowl, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't consider the tech sales that are available thanks to the big game. Key among them is a Sonos sale on Amazon and the company's own site. Speakers and soundbars are up to $250 off this time around, and one of our favorite Sonos products, the Era 100, has dropped to an all-time-low price of $199. The speaker will typically run you $249. 
The Era 100 is our pick for the best midrange smart speaker and we gave it a score of 88 in our review. It delivers great audio and can reach loud volumes, while Bluetooth and line-in support are certainly welcome. With the Era 100, Sonos has simplified its Trueplay tuning feature by making use of built-in microphones to optimize audio output for the room the speaker is in. On the downside, while the Era 100 works with Alexa and Sonos' own voice assistant, it doesn't support Google Assistant. 
  
Like other Sonos speakers, the Era 100 can be used as part of a whole home audio system. So you'll be able to set up units in other rooms so that even when they're away from the TV, your guests can still hear all of the action at the same time as everyone else. 
It's also possible to set up two Era 100 units as rear speakers in a home theater setup. If that's the route you wish to go down, you might want to have a soundbar in place too. As it happens, several of Sonos' models are on sale. 
The original Arc soundbar is down to $649, which is $250 off. As for the Beam Gen 2, that can be yours for $100 less than usual at $399. We reckon the Beam is the best midrange soundbar. However, the Arc Ultra, our recommendation for the best premium soundbar, isn't on sale this time, unfortunately.

The Kindle Colorsoft is back on sale for $50 off,"Here's another chance to get a discount on Amazon's first ereader with a color display. The Kindle Colorsoft has dropped back down to $230. That's $50, or 18 percent, off. The deal brings the Kindle Colorsoft back down to a record low price. 
We saw the Kindle Colorsoft hit $230 for the first time in January. However, that discount was only available to Prime subscribers. There's no such restriction this time around, as you don't need a membership to take advantage of this deal.  
  
There's one additional perk here: the Colorsoft comes with three free months of access to Kindle Unlimited. As such, you'll have access to more than 4 million ebooks during that time. After the free access period is over, your Kindle Unlimited access will automatically renew. The service costs $12 per month, so be sure to cancel before your three-month freebie expires if you don't want to pay for it. 
A number of early Kindle Colorsofts, including our initial review unit, developed a yellow bar across the bottom. However, Amazon said it was resolving the issue, and it offered refunds and replacements to those affected. Although we haven't encountered the problem on our replacement, we have removed the score from our review until we've tested the ereader for a longer period of time and made sure the issue doesn't re-occur. 
That said, we appreciate the quick load times and page turns of the Kindle Colorsoft. The auto-adjusting front light is a plus, while it was very welcome to see that, by default, this model does not have ads on the lock screen. A pinch-to-zoom feature is also handy, especially when it comes to reading graphic novels. 
The ereader has 32GB of built-in storage and it supports Audible audiobooks. It should run for up to weight weeks on a single charge. You can recharge the battery wirelessly or via USB-C. 
The big selling point is, of course, the color screen. The Colorsoft has a seven-inch display with a 300 pixel-per-inch (ppi) density for black-and-white material and 150 ppi for color content. 
Last but not least, the ereader has an IPX8 rating, meaning it can withstand immersion in up to two meters of freshwater for up to 60 minutes and 0.25 meters of seawater for three minutes, per Amazon. As such, you won't have to worry too much about getting the Colorsoft wet when you take it to the pool or beach.

"The 9 best Super Bowl TV deals: Take up to $630 off sets from Samsung, LG, Sony and others","We're a few days from Super Bowl LIX, and it remains a decent time to grab a new TV at a discount. At this point, you'll likely have to buy in-store if you want to make a living room upgrade in time to watch Chiefs and Eagles go at it (again), as shipping times for most sets have stretched beyond Sunday. However, if you don't care so much about football (or Super Bowl commercials) and just want a quality TV at a reasonable price, there are still a number of discounts worth checking out. To save you some time, we've searched through Amazon, Best Buy and other retailers to find a few Super Bowl 2025 TV deals that are actually solid value.&nbsp;
To be candid, many of the better offers stem from TVs naturally falling in price this time of year rather than Super Bowl-specific sales. In general, most TVs follow a similar pricing timeline: arrive in the spring, drop a little over the summer, receive a larger price cut around the holidays, then gradually fall cheaper until being discontinued the following year. We're in the last stage of this pattern now, and with TV makers like Samsung and LG unveiling their 2025 lineups during CES last month, last year's models are likely to drop even further in the months ahead.
That said, if you need to make a change today, a number of well-regarded TVs from LG, Samsung, Sony, TCL and Hisense are back down to the prices we saw around Black Friday. In some cases, they're even cheaper. We're also seeing a couple deals on streamers and soundbars we like from Roku and Sonos. Though we at Engadget do not formally review TVs, we've scoured feedback from other reviewers we trust and checked price histories to ensure everything below is a genuine deal.
LG B4 OLED TV (48"") for $600 at Best Buy ($200 off MSRP): This ties the lowest price we've seen for the 48-inch LG B4, which is the entry-level model in LG's 2024 OLED lineup. While it's not as bright or color-rich as some higher-end alternatives, it still offers the essential perks of any good OLED TV: superb contrast with deep black tones, clear motion, wide viewing angles and the like. It's also a nice value for gaming, as it has four HDMI 2.1 ports that support refresh rates up to 120Hz. It's just better off in a darker room, and this particular model is relatively small.
Hisense U7N QLED TV (65"") for $698 at Amazon ($300 off): Several reviewers we trust say that the U7N delivers better brightness, contrast and HDR performance than most TVs in its price range. It's built with most of the features expected from pricier LED sets, including quantum-dot color, mini-LED backlighting and a 144Hz refresh rate. It also runs on the handy Google TV platform. Its viewing angles are poor, so it's not great for watching shows with a large group, and you may need to tinker with settings to get an optimal image. But the 65-inch model should be a strong value at this price, which is only about $20 more than the all-time low we briefly saw around Cyber Monday. Also at Best Buy. If you'd prefer a smaller size, the 55-inch model is also back within $20 of its best-ever price at $498.
The Samsung Frame TV.Amy Skorheim
Samsung The Frame 2024 QLED TV (55"") for $868 at Woot ($630 off): This deal from Amazon subsidiary Woot has been live for several weeks, but it ties the best price to date for the 55-inch version of Samsung's stylish Frame TV outside of a one-off eBay coupon deal. You'd buy The Frame for its design above all else: It can't match the contrast and color volume of other TVs in its price range, as it lacks local dimming altogether, but it's convincingly built like a framed piece of wall art that can blend in with your home decor. Its matte panel helps it fend off glare in a bright room, and you can display actual artwork onscreen when you're not watching something. It's worth noting that Samsung unveiled a new and improved ""Frame Pro"" TV at CES, but we'd expect that to cost more whenever it arrives.
TCL Q651G QLED TV (65"") for $368 at Amazon ($182 off): The Q651G is a fairly basic LED TV that might appeal to gamers on a budget, as it can play at a fast 120Hz refresh rate — albeit only when you drop the resolution from 4K to 1440p or 1080p. It's another one without local dimming, so its contrast is limited. Most reviewers suggest that the Hisense U6N (which isn't majorly discounted) provides a brighter and much more dynamic image for not much more. However, while the U6N can also play in 1440p/120Hz, the TCL model has a wider variable refresh rate (VRR) range in that mode. In simpler terms, that means it'll have an easier time allowing your PS5 or Xbox games to run smoothly. This discount marks a new low for the 65-inch model. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.
The Samsung S90D.Samsung
Hisense U8N QLED TV (65"") for $898 at Amazon ($602 off): The U8N's picture quality is a broad step-up from the U7N above, with better contrast, more vibrant colors and supremely high peak brightness. It still has most of the same drawbacks — mediocre viewing angles, minor blooming in a dark room, just decent upscaling of lower-res content — but it should be a worthy upgrade if you have more cash to burn. This is another discount we saw for much of November and December, but it ties the all-time low for the 65-inch variant. Also at Best Buy.
Samsung S90D QD-OLED TV (55"") for $1,198 at Amazon ($600 off): The S90D stands out for its QD-OLED panel, which mixes the benefits of an OLED display with a layer of quantum dots to boost color performance. Most reviews say that it can put out a wider gamut of more vibrant colors and brighter HDR highlights than more traditional OLED TVs like the LG C4. It also has four HDMI 2.1 ports that can play up to 144Hz. It doesn't support Dolby Vision HDR, however, and Samsung's Tizen interface can be clunky. The company has also made the aggravating step of using both QD-OLED and more standard WOLED panels within the same product line, but this 55-inch version comes with the superior display in North America. (The 65- and 75-inch models do as well.) This deal is the second-best price we've seen and about $150 off this variant's average street price in recent months. Also at Samsung and Best Buy.&nbsp;
The Sony Bravia 7.Sony
Sony Bravia 7 QLED TV (55"") for $1,198 at Amazon ($100 off): The Bravia 7 isn't as strong of a value as the Hisense U8N, but some reviews suggest that it's a decent alternative if you're willing to trade some contrast and peak brightness for a more accurate picture out of the box. Like the Hisense TV, its image washes out when viewed from an angle and it only has two HDMI 2.1 ports for gaming. In general, most people will be happier with a good OLED TV around this price. But if you want a brighter LED TV that looks great right away, this one might be worth a look. This is a new low for the 55-inch model. Also at B&amp;H and Best Buy.
Roku Ultra (2024) for $79 at Amazon ($21 off): Roku's Ultra set-top box is overkill for most, but it might be worthwhile if you prefer the simplicity of Roku's interface and need built-in Ethernet and USB ports. It supports just about all the major apps and HDR formats, plus it lets iPhone owners cast video from their phone via AirPlay. Unlike the cheaper Roku Streaming Stick 4K, it also comes with a rechargeable remote that has backlit buttons, built-in voice controls and a lost remote finder. We call it the best Roku player in our guide to the best streaming devices. This deal was available for much of the holiday season, but it ties the latest model's all-time low. Also at Roku, B&amp;H and Best Buy.
Sonos Beam (Gen 2) for $399 at Sonos ($100 off): Yes, the recent overhaul of the Sonos app has been an abject disaster, to the point where the audio brand's CEO and chief product officer have left the company entirely. However, if you're not already tied up in the Sonos ecosystem and just want a clean-sounding soundbar that won't chew up a ton of space, the Sonos Beam's hardware still does enough right to be worth a look. We call it the best midrange option in our guide to the best soundbars. It only has one HDMI port, and it's too small to deliver truly room-rattling bass, but it still compares favorably to most alternatives in its size range. This deal is $30 above the device's all-time low but still $100 off its typical street price. Other Sonos home theater gadgets are similarly discounted, including the more compact Sonos Ray for $179 and the Sub 4 subwoofer for $679. These offers are also available at Amazon and other retailers. Sonos says they'll run until February 9.
TV deals that are no longer available
LG C3 OLED TV (65"") for $1,197 at Amazon ($303 off): The LG C3 was released in 2023, but it's not a huge downgrade from last year's LG C4, so it's still worth considering when it's available for less. The C4 should be slightly better in terms of brightness and color volume, plus it supports refresh rates up to 144Hz rather than 120Hz, though the latter is only really useful for PC gaming. Neither model can quite match the QD-OLED panel on the Samsung S90D, but the C3 will still look excellent if you're not comparing the two side-by-side and just want to save some cash on a larger premium display. This discount ties the lowest price we've tracked outside of a handful of in-store-only and eBay coupon deals.
Sony A95L OLED TV (65"") for $2,498 at eBay via BuyDig ($500 off): The A95L is wildly expensive even with this discount, but many reviewers agree that it's the best TV on the market if money is no object. It's another QD-OLED TV like the Samsung S90D, but it's more color-accurate out of the box and should be better at preserving details in shows that aren't presented in 4K. It also supports Dolby Vision, unlike Samsung's TVs, and its Google TV software is generally easier to navigate than Tizen. The only serious drawback is that it's limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports, which may be annoying for those who own a soundbar and multiple game consoles. This discount from ties the lowest price to date for the 65-inch model; just use the code SAVEBIG20 at checkout. It comes from eBay via BuyDig, which Sony lists as an authorized seller.

Weber Searwood review: Second time’s the charm,"When Weber launched a smart grilling platform, a connected grilling hub and its first pellet grill in 2020, the company’s new era hit a few speedbumps. The Weber Connect technology was a solid foundation for aspiring outdoor cooks at any skill level, but the SmokeFire grill suffered from big temperature fluctuations, pellet feeding issues and was prone to grease fires. Those problems led to inconsistent performance for a lot of people. 
In 2024, the company debuted an all-new model as it sought to move past the troubles of its first. The Searwood ($899 and up) offers a new design with a reworked internal construction for a more direct auger path for those pellets. It’s still a smart grill, so Weber Connect is onboard once again. But the biggest changes are a lower price and a manual mode that allows you to cook with the lid open without sacrificing performance. 
  
The design of the Weber Searwood 
While the Searwood has a similar overall barrel shape to the SmokeFire, there are some notable changes. First, the pellet hopper was moved from the back to the side, with the new location being what a lot of the competition offers. This simplifies the auger path too, which should remedy some of the problems users encountered on the previous version. The display and controller is now on the front edge of the grill instead of toward the back which makes for easier access. The hopper was relocated where the small shelf was, but you can use the top of the pellet holder to rest any tools or pans. 
Another big change on the Searwood is its legs and wheels. Where the SmokeFire had sturdy legs with durable casters on each one, this version has two regular wheels on one end and just legs on the other. This makes the Searwood more difficult to move, and it means you’ll have to pick up one end to relocate it. All the heavy stuff is on the wheeled side, so this isn’t a big lift, but the lack of casters means you’ll need more room to maneuver.

The new wheels are entirely plastic and the legs aren’t as robust as what was on the SmokeFire. Perhaps this is one area where Weber felt it could save money to lower the price of Searwood. If you’re not moving the grill a lot, this probably won’t be a concern, but the lack of quality here stood out to me. You do gain a large shelf under the grill, which is something the SmokeFire didn’t offer. 
Going back to the controller and display, Weber did an excellent job with the update there. The numbers are bolder and easier to read from a distance and the single-knob controls are simple to use. The display can show you set temperature, actual temperature, probe temperature and timers, plus there are mode indicators and a fuel gauge that keeps tabs on pellets. All around, the new display and controller is an upgrade over what was on the SmokeFire. 
Inside, rows of the company’s Flavorizer bars were replaced with a single, larger deflector that shields the fire pot from grease and food debris. All of that waste and pellet dust can be scraped to the bottom of the grill for easy removal via the slide-out pan underneath. You’ll still probably want to use a shop vac for deep cleaning, but you can get rid of a lot of waste with just a scraper. 
Cooking with the Weber Searwood 
 
 
 
  Billy Steele for Engadget
 
 
Like all pellet grills, the Searwood has a wide temperature range that allows you to use it for slow smoking and quick searing. More specifically, those numbers go from 180-600 degrees Fahrenheit, so baking, roasting and more are also possible. I mostly use pellet grills for hands-off, low-and-slow barbeque of large cuts like brisket, pork shoulders and ribs. That’s where I focused most of my testing, although I made sure to give this grill’s open-lid feature a few trial runs. 
For slow smoking, the Searwood is a reliable machine, maintaining heat throughout the cook and recovering quickly each time I open the lid. That latter feature is thanks to the grill’s Rapid React system that also preheats the device in 15 minutes or less. The Searwood imparts lovely smoke flavor in various foods, but pork shoulders (Boston Butts) and our Thanksgiving turkey were my two favorites. My wife no longer allows me to cook our holiday bird any other way after I smoked it on a Searwood. 
Most pellet grills have a setting that allows you to enhance flavor with more smoke at certain temperatures. Weber calls this SmokeBoost, but it only works at 180 degrees. I would’ve liked for this to be available at any temperature under 225 degrees, like Traeger offers on its products, for some more versatility. Weber recommends that you use SmokeBoost at the beginning of your cook for extra smokiness before raising the temperature to your desired level. To be clear, the grill puts plenty of smoke into your food without this, so if the low starting temperature is off-putting, you certainly don’t have to use SmokeBoost.

A big addition to the Searwood is the manual mode that allows you to use the grill with the lid open. This means you can use it for direct-flame searing or as a griddle, if you have the proper insert to do the latter. Unlike a lot of pellet grills, the Searwood’s manual mode keeps fuel and fan speed constant with the lid up, so it can maintain output at times when other grills would pause. You just select a level of 1-10 corresponding to how hot you need to cook and the grill does the rest. This works well, but you’ll probably still want a charcoal kettle for live-fire searing in most cases. During my tests, I preferred to use the Searwood as a griddle rather than a sear machine. 
The Searwood’s smart features come through a Wi-Fi connection to the Weber Connect app. This is the software the company debuted in 2020 when it first launched its smart grilling platform. However, Weber has significantly updated the app over the last few years and the current version offers a smooth experience. With Weber Connect, you can monitor temperatures and control the grill remotely, plus there are live graphs that plot out your progress, notifications to tell you when food is ready and there’s a ton of recipes when you need some ideas. 
Weber Searwood accessories 
The degree to which you can customize a new grill is almost as important as its factory features. Weber has been providing add-ons via its Weber Crafted collection for a while now, and some of those items are compatible with the Searwood. Once you have the required frame kit, you can utilize a smaller griddle insert, dual-sided sear grate, pizza stone and grilling basket. My favorite accessories for this grill are the rotisserie and the full-size griddle insert for $130 and $149 respectively. 
If you need more shelf space, you’ll have to buy extra pieces. There are folding options that attach to both the front and side of the Searwood, and they’re both $75. You’ll need to replace the side handle with the shelf if you go that route. 
The competition 
 
 
 
  Billy Steele for Engadget
 
 
At $899, the Searwood 600 is $100 cheaper than the SmokeFire EX4 was at launch. Like its predecessor, the Searwood comes in two sizes, with the larger XL 600 starting at $1,199. The SmokeFire is no longer available, but Weber just announced the Smoque and Smoque XL at $699 and $899, respectively, if you want alternatives from the same company. Those new grills have a simplified controller and other streamlined changes, but the overall design is similar to the Searwood. I expect to review the Smoque sometime this spring. 
Traeger recently announced its Woodridge lineup and the mid-level option in that trio is a solid alternative to the Searwood. The Woodridge Pro is more expensive than the Searwood 600 at $1,000, but it’s also a larger grill. The entry-level, $800 Woodridge is a workhorse that handles the basics without some of Traeger’s handy features. Jump to the Woodridge Pro and you get shelves, Super Smoke mode and a pellet sensor in the hopper. 
Wrap-up 
Don’t call it a comeback, but Weber’s Searwood is a good rebound from the stumbles of the SmokeFire. The grill is definitely more reliable than its predecessor and most of the changes enhance the overall cooking experience. Manual mode is a nice bonus, as is the addition of a fuel sensor in the pellet hopper. My biggest gripe is the base, where I wish the company had gone with something sturdier like Traeger implemented on the base-model Woodridge. Still, the Searwood is a versatile smart grill without the headaches, and that’s exactly what you want when you’re spending precious time cooking outdoors.

Apple's AirPods Pro 2 are 32 percent off and down to $169,"If you're on the market for a new pair of wireless earbuds, the latest sale on the AirPods Pro 2 is a good one to consider. They're down to $169 right now, which is 32 percent off their regular price. While not quite as low as we saw them during the holiday shopping season last year ($154), this is the best price they've been in 2025 so far. 
Apple's AirPods Pro 2 came out in 2022 and yet we still rate them the best wireless earbuds for iPhone. At the time, we gave them a score of 88 thanks to big improvements from their predecessor, including fantastic sound and an amazing transparency mode. They'll last you six hours at a time with ANC on or seven hours without it.&nbsp; 
  
Notably, Apple's newest generation of earbuds are also on sale. The AirPods 4 are down to a new all-time low price of $100, from $129, thanks to a 22 percent discount. We also gave the AirPods 4 an 88 in our review, noting their improved fit, comfort and sound quality. Their biggest drawback is the lack of ANC but, if you don't need that, then this is a great deal.&nbsp;

Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2 are $40 off right now,"Looking to upgrade to newer earbuds? The recently-released Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 earbuds are on sale via Wellbots for $189. That’s a discount of $40, which isn’t bad for a product that’s barely six months old. Just remember to pop in the code “ENGAD40” at checkout. That’s right. This one’s an exclusive. 
The Pixel Buds Pro 2 easily found a spot on our list of the best wireless earbuds. We appreciated the tiny, yet comfortable, design and the fantastic battery life. The earbuds get around eight hours of use per charge, but the included charging case allows for 30 hours of juice. 
  
We were complimentary to these earbuds in our official review, saying that “the improved fit and sound quality alone are worth the upgrade.” Speaking of sound quality, these buds produce booming bass, full mids and crisp highs. Your playlists are gonna sound great. 
The earbuds have also been built to work with Google Gemini, thanks to an integrated Tensor A1 chip. However, this integration works best when paired with a modern Google Pixel phone. Other techy features include active noise cancellation, multipoint Bluetooth, conversation detection and more. 
On the downside, the touch panel is extremely small, making it somewhat difficult to make adjustments on the fly. Luckily, there’s an app for that kind of thing. The original price is on the higher side, but this sale alleviates a bit of that frustration. 
If $189 is still a bit too rich for your blood (no judgment), Wellbots is also selling a pair of the standard Google Pixel Buds for just $59. Just enter the code “ENGAD30” at checkout.

OnePlus 13 review: A focused flagship that ignores the AI hype,"OnePlus has been a bit up and down since it merged with Oppo back in 2021. It gained greater access to powerful components and partnerships with brands like Hasselblad, while its software and product lineup took a few steps back before finding its stride again. But now, three generations after the merger, OnePlus’ latest flagship phone — the OnePlus 13 — feels like a fantastic return to form. In some areas, the company is even pushing the limits of hardware and gadget design in ways that rivals from Samsung and Google aren’t. And with a starting price of $900, OnePlus has managed to undercut its closest competitor too, which makes this phone a great choice for anyone who cares more about getting hardware upgrades than fancy new AI tricks. 
  
Design and display: Peak brightness and style 
In a time when Apple, Google and Samsung’s top phones all sport minor twists on practically the same formula, I love that OnePlus is doing its own thing. Instead of a completely boxy design, the OP13 has tapered edges that curve gently to meet its metal frame. You still get the company’s signature Alert Slider which makes it a cinch to set your phone’s ringer to silent, vibrate or fully audible. But my favorite design feature is that if you opt for the Midnight Ocean or Artic Dawn colors, the phone comes with a micro-fiber vegan leather back. And in a world full of glass bricks, OnePlus’ organic upholstery is simply a joy to touch. This is the kind of handset I’d feel sad to throw in a case. 
 
 
 
  Sam Rutherford for Engadget
 
 
Meanwhile, the OP13’s 6.8-inch OLED panel dazzles thanks to bright, vivid colors and a silky 120Hz refresh rate. With a peak of up to 4,500 nits, it gets even brighter than other Android flagships including Samsung’s new Galaxy S25 Ultra (2,600 nits). The one aesthetic choice I’m still not sure about is the gigantic circular camera module on the back. Between its pearlescent finish and the four circles for its lenses and the flash/autofocus system, it almost looks like OnePlus smashed a chronograph watch into the rear of the phone. But maybe that’s just me. 
Performance and software: So much memory 
The OnePlus 13 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip along with 16GB of RAM and up to 512GB of storage. However, unlike the processors used in Samsung’s Galaxy S25 family, the chip in the OP13 doesn’t feature any additional customizations or overclocking. This leads to benchmark results that are about five percent lower (9,267 for the OP13 vs 9,828 for the Galaxy S25 Ultra in Geekbench 6 multi-core). In the real world, though, the phone still feels blisteringly fast. 
I’d even argue that due to the OP13’s greater amount of memory, it’s a better choice for multitaskers or anyone who likes keeping a bunch of apps open in the background. Furthermore, over the past few years, OnePlus has refined Oxygen OS so that it feels smoother and more responsive than it did when it became a fork of Oppo’s ColorOS back in 2022. 
 
 
 
  Sam Rutherford for Engadget
 
 
On the AI front, OnePlus is keeping things refreshingly lowkey. The phone supports Google Gemini and Circle to Search for all your summarizing and question-asking needs. There’s also an improved search feature inside the phone itself that makes it a bit easier to find specific files and a smarter Notes app that uses machine learning to polish up, elaborate or condense quick thoughts. But that’s about it aside from an AI-powered translation feature that arrived shortly after launch, which is generally competent but not especially novel or exciting. So while AI is definitely present, it isn’t nearly as big of a focus as it is on the Galaxy S25 family, which isn’t a bad thing. 
Cameras: Nearly top tier 
 
 
 
  Sam Rutherford for Engadget
 
 
The OnePlus 13 features a trio of 50-megapixel sensors for its main, ultra-wide and 3x telephoto lenses, plus a laser-detect autofocus system for increased sharpness. Altogether, it’s a solid package that can capture great-looking images at a variety of distances and viewing angles, with OnePlus adding things like its dual exposure Clear Burst tech to help make snapping fast-moving subjects a bit easier. 
In terms of image quality, the OP13 does a good job of splitting the difference between having rich, saturated colors and crisp details, but without exaggerating things like you often see on Samsung phones, which tend to oversharpen or push warm tones a bit too hard. OnePlus’ 3x optical zoom lens matches those on similarly priced rivals like the S25+, though it's still short of the 5x lenses found on the Pixel 9 Pro and S25 Ultra.  
One small issue is that in low light, the OP13’s Night Mode sometimes struggled to keep up with the Pixel 9’s Night Sight, resulting in photos that aren’t quite as sharp or detailed as you’d like them to be. It’s close, but to me, OnePlus’ cameras remain a half-tier below Samsung, Google and Apple when shooting pics in darker environments. 
Battery life and charging: Super fast, but it’s proprietary 
It feels like every high-end Android phone has been stuck with 5,000mAh batteries for the past half-decade. But for this go around, the OnePlus 13 has smashed past that barrier with a 6,000mAh cell, resulting in class-leading longevity. On our local video rundown test, it posted a time of 30 hours and 18 minutes, which is almost an hour longer than the Galaxy S25 Ultra (29:27) and nearly three hours better than a basic Pixel 9 (27:32). 
 
 
 
  Sam Rutherford for Engadget
 
 
Meanwhile when it comes to recharging, the OnePlus 13 leads the way too with wired speeds of up to 100 watts or an impressive 50 watts wirelessly. However, the major caveat is that because OnePlus relies on its proprietary SUPERVOOC tech, you’ll only get those blistering rates when using the company’s first-party peripherals. Thankfully, an 80-watt charger comes in the box, though if you want to hit max power, you’ll need to upgrade to OnePlus’ 100W Dual Port adapter. It’s a similar situation for wireless charging, which requires the company’s 50W AIRVOOC puck. That said, the OP13 recharges more than twice as fast as a Galaxy S25 when using a cable and more than three times quicker wirelessly. Plus, you can still use universal power adapters in a pinch, you’ll just have to live with greatly reduced wattages. 
Another small wrinkle is that though OnePlus says the 13 supports Qi2 charging, it doesn’t play nicely with magnetic third-party accessories without some help. In my testing, while the phone provides a weak magnetic connection, every Qi2 peripheral I tried slid off with the slightest movement. Like Samsung did with the Galaxy S25, OnePlus’ solution was to make a case with its own set of magnets that allows add-ons to attach with much greater security. 
Wrap-up 
 
 
 
  Sam Rutherford for Engadget
 
 
Throughout the years, OnePlus has used taglines like “flagship killer” and “ultra in every way” as a means of taking shots at its biggest rivals from Samsung, Google and more. But for the OnePlus 13, it feels like the company just went and made a really solid premium handset without a bunch of AI fluff. The phone has excellent performance, a massive battery and a gorgeous screen that can hang with the displays on any of its competitors. It also sports a unique design with some down-to-earth touches like its optional faux leather back. 
Granted, camera quality could be a touch better, especially in low light, and I really wish OnePlus had just included full magnetic Qi2 compatibility instead of forcing people to rely on a case. But hey, at least you get a superfast wired power adapter (which, unlike a lot of phones, comes in the box) and the option to use the company’s blazing charging puck if you want to go cable-free.

But most importantly, for a starting price of $900, you get longer battery life, a brighter screen, more RAM, greater storage and the same 3x zoom as a base Galaxy S25+ — all for $100 less. There’s no other way to put it, that’s just a good deal, even if OnePlus’ software support only lasts for six years instead of the seven you get from Samsung and Google. The OnePlus 13 is an example of how to keep things simple in an increasingly complex and AI-obsessed world while delivering on all the essentials.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/oneplus-13-review-a-focused-flagship-that-ignores-the-ai-hype-140013418.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/oneplus-13-review-a-focused-flagship-that-ignores-the-ai-hype-140013418.html?src=rss,"Fri, 07 Feb 2025 14:00:13 +0000",Sports,www.engadget.com
The Morning After: Apple’s Invite app and its less welcome third-party porn apps,"The week has been a mixed bag for Apple. First, it launched a new iPhone app for organizing events and being actually social; then, it had to contend with a third-party app store offering a porn app in the European Union. And there’s nothing like an Apple-pornography headline to draw the eye.
But first, Apple Invites, where you can host an unlimited number of events, each one limited to 100 participants. It’s also possible to invite non-iPhone users. What?!
You can use your own photos or backgrounds in the app as an image for the invite and even arrange a communal playlist through Apple Music.
Of course, there’s some Apple Intelligence shoehorned in. Image Playground is built into Invites to generate images for your events when there aren’t any appropriate photos.
Engadget
What about the future for existing invite apps, like Evite, Partiful, Luma and the rest? Well, all isn’t lost: Only paid iCloud subscribers can create invites in the app — and prices start there at 99 cents a month, while rival apps offer free basic event invites. Also, the web experience for non-iPhone people is pretty clunky and painful. At least for now.
Meanwhile, a third-party app store called AltStore PAL announced a porn app called Hot Tub was now available to iOS users in the European Union. The marketplace described it as the “first Apple-approved porn app” — which probably isn’t entirely accurate.
It’s seemingly the first time a porn app has been available natively for the iPhone. Apple said it was “deeply concerned about the safety risks that hardcore porn apps of this type create for EU users, especially kids.”
And just to add further corporate spice: Longtime Apple App Store foe Epic gave the alternative app store a MegaGrant last year to help fund the “core technology fees” third-party app stores are required to pay Apple. Not that it’s directly affiliated with this adult entertainment portal. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney took to X to say, “the Epic Games Store doesn’t carry this app, doesn’t carry any porn apps, and has never carried porn apps.”

Despite the appearance of rival smart rings from the likes of Samsung, the Oura Ring 4 remains the best option. It tracks your sleep, activity and stress levels, is comfortable to wear and looks, shock, like a regular ring. The battery life is admirable, lasting up to seven days, with new features including 24/7 heart rate tracking and temperature monitoring. However, these features are only available if you pay for a monthly subscription — and that may remain the biggest caveat for this $349 ring.

Football Manager 25 has been cancelled,"Sports Interactive has officially cancelled Football Manager 25 after its release was delayed by months from the series&#39; usual launch window. In its announcement, the developer said that it made the decision after an extensive discussion with Sega, its publisher, and that it&#39;s skipping this version to focus on the next installment instead. Football Manager is a football (or soccer) management SIM game series that typically gets a yearly release. The last one, Football Manager 2024, came out in 2023, and this particular installment was supposed to be released in November last year before it was pushed back to March 2025.&nbsp;
The developer explained that it truly believed it would be able to reach the level of quality it was aiming for when it announced the March release date, but it encountered &quot;challenges&quot; that made it unable to reach its goal. Sports Interactive previously said that things were moving slower than it predicted to be able to produce the game it wanted. It was &quot;rushing too much and in danger of compromising [its] usual standards,&quot; it added.
It sounds like the company got close to being able to release the game, as &quot;many areas&quot; had hit its targets. However, the &quot;overarching player experience and interface&quot; are &quot;not where [the company] need it to be.&quot; The developer promised &quot;the biggest technical and visual advancement in the series&quot; with Football Manager 25, and it would not be able to deliver on that if it pushes through with its plan to launch the game this March. It was also unwilling to move the release date again, since the next version is already scheduled for launch later this year. Those who&#39;ve already pre-ordered the game will get a refund for their purchase.&nbsp;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/football-manager-25-has-been-cancelled-133053048.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/football-manager-25-has-been-cancelled-133053048.html?src=rss,"Fri, 07 Feb 2025 13:30:53 +0000",Sports,www.engadget.com
Meta and UNESCO team up to improve translation AI,"Meta has partnered with UNESCO on a new plan to improve translation and speech recognition AI, Techcrunch reported. As part of its Language Technology Partner Program, Meta is seeking collaborators willing to donate at least 10 hours of speech recordings with transcriptions, large written texts (200-plus sentences) and sets of translated sentences. The aim is to focus on &quot;underserved languages, in support of UNESCO&#39;s work,&quot; Meta wrote in a blog post.&nbsp;
So far, Meta and UNESCO have signed on the government of Nunavut, a northern Canadian territory. The aim is to develop translation systems for the Intuit languages used there, Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun. &quot;Our efforts are especially focused on underserved languages, in support of UNESCO’s work as part of the International Decade of Indigenous Languages,&quot; Meta said.&nbsp;
As part of the program, Meta is releasing an open source translation benchmark called BOUQuET — a standard test to evaluate performance of AI models that do translation. It&#39;ll be composed of sentences &quot;carefully crafted by linguistic experts,&quot; and is seeking contributions on a dedicated site.&nbsp;
Meta has taken a strong interest in AI translation for both text and speech, a logical move for a company that connects users around the world. Last year, it showed off a tool that uses AI to automatically dub Reels into other languages, complete with lip-sync, promising it would roll out to some creators videos in English and Spanish in the US first. The company has gradually expanded its Meta AI assistant around the world and it&#39;s now available in 43 countries and over a dozen languages.&nbsp;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-and-unesco-team-up-to-improve-translation-ai-130050762.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-and-unesco-team-up-to-improve-translation-ai-130050762.html?src=rss,"Fri, 07 Feb 2025 13:00:50 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
Engadget Podcast: Volvo Group’s CTO on his vision for zero-emission trucks,"This week, Devindra chats with Volvo Group CTO Lars Stenqvist about the company’s progress developing zero emissions trucks, both of the electric variety and experimental hydrogen options. While it’s a completely different company from Volvo Cars, Volvo Group still impacts consumers as one of the largest producers of heavy trucks. Stenqvist dives into how Volvo is thinking about new technology, and we chat a bit about how it’s approaching completely autonomous vehicles. (Note: This interview was recorded in early January, so we didn’t have a chance to talk about this week’s partnership between Volvo and the self-driving truck startup Waabi.)

Apple will reportedly announce a new iPhone SE next week,"In just few days, Apple could finally unveil a new iPhone SE. According to Bloomberg, the company will announce its latest lower-cost model as soon as next week before it goes on sale later this month. The last iPhone SE was released back in 2022, and the publication says that Apple Stores have been running low on stocks in recent weeks. A few days ago, a Twitter user who goes by &quot;Majin Bu&quot; posted a video of a device that&#39;s supposedly Apple&#39;s upcoming low-cost iPhone model. Unlike the current version, it no longer has a home button marking the death of a feature that once identified the company&#39;s mobile devices.&nbsp;
The upcoming iPhone SE will reportedly have a camera notch at the top, which Apple had removed from its latest phones in favor of its Dynamic Island design. It&#39;s also expected to have a USB-C port, which will allow Apple to sell it in the European Union, where all mobile devices are required to have USB-C charging capability. Apple had to stop selling the 2022 version and the iPhone 14 in the region late last year when the rule came into effect.&nbsp;
Bloomberg previously reported that the new iPhone SE will be the first Apple device to use the company&#39;s in-house cellular modem, replacing the Qualcomm chips it&#39;s been using up until now. The phone is also expected to have Face ID and Apple Intelligence, made possible by the company&#39;s A18 processor. The publication&#39;s sources said Apple isn&#39;t likely to hold a launch event for the device and will simply just start selling it on its website. At launch, the older version carried a retail price of $429, but that was two years ago — you can probably expect the new model with its more modern specs to cost a bit more.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-will-reportedly-announce-a-new-iphone-se-next-week-120006642.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-will-reportedly-announce-a-new-iphone-se-next-week-120006642.html?src=rss,"Fri, 07 Feb 2025 12:00:06 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
UK officials are reportedly demanding backdoor access to Apple iCloud accounts,"UK officials have ordered Apple to create a backdoor that would allow them to see what users worldwide have saved on their iCloud accounts, according to The Washington Post. Their order reportedly demands blanket capability to view all of a user&#39;s fully encrypted material whenever they want, wherever the target is located.&nbsp;
While only certain iCloud data is end-to-end encrypted by default, users can choose to activate Advanced Data Protection for better security. With the optional setting enabled, the majority of a user&#39;s data is protected by encryption, including their iCloud Backup, Photos and Notes. Except encryption won&#39;t do users any good if authorities in the UK decide to take a look at their iCloud content.&nbsp;
Apple will likely stop offering encrypted storage to users in the UK, The Post&#39;s sources said, so it wouldn&#39;t have to promise them greater security knowing that authorities will be able to access their account. As the publication notes, though, it doesn&#39;t solve the issue of authorities demanding a backdoor entrance for all accounts, even for users outside the region.&nbsp;
Authorities issued the order under the UK Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which covers how they can get their hands on data and information for law enforcement purposes. When the UK government made changes to the Act last year, it said they were meant to &quot;ensure the intelligence services and law enforcement have the powers they need to keep pace with a range of evolving threats from terrorists, hostile state actors, child abusers and criminal gangs.&quot; The company won&#39;t be able to confirm receiving the order, because it would be a criminal offense to do so. But it if did indeed get one, then Google, which has more users around the world, might also receive one soon if it hasn&#39;t gotten one yet.&nbsp;
Apple received a draft of the order when those changes were being debated by government officials last year. In a written submission protesting them, it said that the planned provisions &quot;could be used to force a company like Apple, that would never build a back door into its products, to publicly withdraw critical security features from the UK market.&quot; The Post says the company can still appeal the notice, but it can&#39;t use that appeal to put off its compliance.&nbsp;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/uk-officials-are-reportedly-demanding-backdoor-access-to-apple-icloud-accounts-113556534.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/uk-officials-are-reportedly-demanding-backdoor-access-to-apple-icloud-accounts-113556534.html?src=rss,"Fri, 07 Feb 2025 11:35:56 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
The best VR headsets for 2025,"Virtual reality has come a long way, and VR headsets are now more exciting and accessible than ever. These devices transport you to entirely new worlds, whether you’re slaying dragons in VR gaming, exploring distant planets or even attending virtual meetings. They’re designed to immerse you in lifelike visuals and interactive experiences, making them perfect for gamers, tech enthusiasts and even people looking for creative new ways to stay connected.There’s a wide variety of options to suit every need. Standalone headsets like the Meta Quest 3s don’t require a powerful PC or console — they work independently to deliver amazing virtual reality experiences. On the other hand, advanced devices like the Apple Vision Pro take things to the next level with cutting-edge features and high-end visuals. You’ll also find tethered systems that pair with gaming PCs or consoles for even more detailed graphics and performance, as well as lightweight head-mounted displays for simple, portable VR. If you’re searching for the best VR headset for gaming, productivity, or just some casual fun, these are the headsets to consider right now.

How we test VR headsets 
I tend to judge VR headsets on a few basic criteria: Ergonomics, immersion and controls. It's not that hard to shove a mobile display into a plastic headset and strap some cheap elastic headbands onto it. But it takes skill to craft something that's well balanced and doesn't feel uncomfortable after 30 minutes. 
My test for ergonomics is fairly simple: How long can I wear a headset until I start to feel discomfort? For the most ergonomic devices, like the Quest 3, that could easily be an hour or two. But heavier PC hardware often feels cumbersome after just 15 minutes — you won’t find headsets guilty of that in this guide. 
Immersion, meanwhile, comes from having the highest resolution screens with fast refresh rates, like a 120Hz refresh rate, so everything looks sharp and smooth. Field of view is also a major element, as it describes how well VR screens can cover what you see. Having a narrow field of view makes it feel like you’re looking through a pair of binoculars, and limits your sense of “presence,” or the idea that you’re actually transported to a virtual world. 
A wide field of view, on the other hand, can make it seem like you’re actually flying over the globe in Google Earth. We look at a few popular video games, like Superhot, Beat Saber and Pistol Whip, on every headset to judge how immersed we feel and how enjoyable the gaming experience is overall. 
The best controllers fit naturally in your hands and offer accurate tracking. The industry has basically adopted the design of Meta’s excellent touch controllers, but we're also seeing intriguing leaps forward like Valve's finger tracking gamepads. We judge controllers based on how easy they are to hold, how they hold up to sweaty gameplay sessions and how easily headsets can track their position in space. 
However, it’s important to look at a virtual reality headset’s specs as a whole. Depending on what you’re looking for from a VR headset, you’ll want to consider factors like your PC’s CPU and graphics card if you plan to use the headset to play the best VR games. You might not need a super powerful PC, but you should check the minimum requirements for the headset you’re looking to purchase. If you’re not looking to invest in a VR headset solely for gaming, features like head tracking allow you to explore your environment just by simply moving your head in the simulator. This often results in a more immersive and realistic experience. 
Other VR headsets we’ve tested 
HTC Vive Focus Vision 
The Vive Focus Vision is a sleek premium standalone VR headset that can also deliver solid PC VR. But it’s also running aging hardware, it’s riddled with software issues and it’s expensive compared to the Meta Quest 3. 
Meta Quest Pro 
As great as the Meta Quest 3 is, the Quest 2 is still a very good entry-level VR headset, and it’s worth considering if it’s on sale below its current $250 list price. The Meta Quest Pro, on the the hand, is an expensive boondoggle best ignored. 
HTC Vive Pro 2 
Outside of Meta’s hardware, the HTC Vive Pro 2 remains a fantastic PC headset, but it’s far more expensive than the Valve Index, which is more comfortable and offers better audio. 
VR headset FAQs 
How do VR headsets work? 
At the most basic level, a VR headset is simply a high quality screen that you’re holding up to your face. For a wired headset, the actual work of rendering a game is done on either a PC or game console. For completely wireless devices, like the Meta Quest 3, that work is handled right on the headset. They rely on either external sensors, or sensors built into the headsets, to map your physical space. While you can use a traditional gamepad or keyboard and mouse in VR, they typically use motion tracking controllers to immerse you in their 3D environments. 
What VR headset is best for full body tracking? 
While we’re still waiting for a truly great haptic VR bodysuit to arrive, you can still achieve accurate body tracking with most Steam VR-compatible PC headsets. The Valve Index and HTC Vive Pro 2 both rely on room-tracking sensors that can map your body more effectively than the built-in sensors on competitors. You can also add HTC Vive Trackers to wrist and leg straps, as well as belts, for even better coverage. The Meta Quest 3 doesn’t have any easy body tracking solutions, but you can add Vive trackers when it’s plugged into your PC to mimic a Steam VR headset. 
Only a few experiences, like VRChat, take advantage of full body tracking at the moment. Currently there aren’t any body tracking solutions for the PlayStation VR and VR2, but we’re intrigued by the company’s Mocopi body trackers, which were really announced in Japan. 
What VR headsets are better than Oculus? 
Oculus is the previous name for Meta’s VR hardware. Currently, Meta only supports the Quest 3, Quest 3S and Quest Pro, all of which are wireless headsets. As we explain above, PC VR headsets can generally achieve better quality virtual reality, since they rely on more powerful graphics hardware. 
What VR headsets work with Xbox? 
Currently, Microsoft’s Xbox consoles don’t support any VR headsets.

Magic: The Gathering lands deal for film and TV adaptions with Legendary Entertainment,"Hasbro Entertainment and Legendary Entertainment have joined forces to bring Magic: The Gathering to the big and small screens. The pair have signed a licensing deal to create ""a live-action feature film and television universe"" inspired by the card game. First up will be a movie, with other media to follow, but that's all that's been revealed so far.
Longtime MTG fans might feel skeptical about this announcement, because this isn't the first time the intellectual property has been promised some kind of film or television adaptation. The card game's Fandom wiki page lists many of the proposed movie projects over the years. First up was a plan for multiple movies with Universal all the way back in 2008, which never yielded anything. Then Hasbro made an attempt at a movie with Twentieth Century Fox in 2014, but that was also never heard from again. Netflix has also been attached to two different rumored Magic projects, but it seems like the streamer's animated TV series might really come to pass, with a post on Tudum from September 2024 promising that it's really happening and in production.
Legendary Entertainment has had several projects drawing on geek culture, usually bringing a big budget and a dark edge to their work. Most recently the studio worked on Dune and Dune: Part Two, and it also was involved in Christopher Nolan's take on Batman in The Dark Knight movies as well as the Warcraft movie. MTG has a lot of lore to draw on, so there's plenty of fodder for a cinematic universe. Here's hoping the producers and talent have the understanding to turn all that potential into a good movie.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/magic-the-gathering-lands-deal-for-film-and-tv-adaptions-with-legendary-entertainment-000159168.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/magic-the-gathering-lands-deal-for-film-and-tv-adaptions-with-legendary-entertainment-000159168.html?src=rss,"Fri, 07 Feb 2025 00:01:59 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
Kaspersky researchers find screenshot-reading malware on the App Store and Google Play,"Researchers from Kaspersky have identified malware being distributed within apps on both Android and iOS mobile storefronts. Dmitry Kalinin and Sergey Puzan shared their investigation into a malware campaign, which they have dubbed SparkCat, that has likely been active since March 2024.
&quot;We cannot confirm with certainty whether the infection was a result of a supply chain attack or deliberate action by the developers,&quot; the pair wrote. &quot;Some of the apps, such as food delivery services, appeared to be legitimate, whereas others apparently had been built to lure victims.&quot; They said SparkCat is a stealthy operation that at a glance appears to be requesting normal or harmless permissions.&nbsp;
On February 6, Kaspersky updated its report to note that the affected apps had been deleted from the App Store. Apple confirmed that it had removed the 11 apps, adding that the applications shared code with 89 apps that previously had been rejected or removed from the store.
The malware in question uses optical character recognition (OCR) to review a device&#39;s photo library, seeking screenshots of recovery phrases for crypto wallets. Based on their assessment, infected Google Play apps have been downloaded more than 242,000 times. Kaspersky says &quot;This is the first known case of an app infected with OCR spyware being found in Apple’s official app marketplace.&quot;
Apple often promotes the rigorous security of the App Store, and while instances of malware appearing have been rare, this discovery is a reminder that the walled garden is not impervious to attacks.
Update, February 6, 2025, 5:15PM ET: Revised to note an update from the Kaspersky report about the apps being removed from the App Store, as well as additional context from Apple.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/kaspersky-researchers-find-screenshot-reading-malware-on-the-app-store-and-google-play-211011103.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/kaspersky-researchers-find-screenshot-reading-malware-on-the-app-store-and-google-play-211011103.html?src=rss,"Thu, 06 Feb 2025 22:16:04 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
US lawmakers want DeepSeek banned from government devices,"Two US Congress members plan to introduce bipartisan legislation to ban China’s DeepSeek AI chatbot from government devices. The bill’s announcement came after a security expert said DeepSeek not only poses a threat to US AI stocks; it’s also a national security risk. The chatbot has recently been the most downloaded app in the US.
U.S. Representatives Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) and Darin LaHood (R-IL), each party’s senior-most member on the House Select Committee on Intelligence, plan to introduce the “No DeepSeek on Government Devices Act.” If all of this sounds familiar, the move echoes Congress’ blocking of TikTok from government devices in 2022. That was the opening salvo in a saga that culminated in the US-wide ban the app is now staring down.
The alarm follows an independent analysis from Feroot Security claiming that DeepSeek’s code sends user data directly to the Chinese government-owned China Mobile. “We see direct links to servers and companies in China that are under control of the Chinese government,” Feroot analyst Ivan Tsarynny said in an interview with ABC News. “This is something we’ve never seen before.”
“Our personal information is being sent to China, there is no denial, and the DeepSeek tool is collecting everything that American users connect to it,” Tsarynny told the Wall Street Journal. ABC reported on Wednesday that multiple cybersecurity experts verified Feroot’s findings.
The US Navy and NASA have already banned DeepSeek from their employees’ devices. Texas is the only state to have blocked the app from government devices. Three other countries have already beat the US to the punch in banning the app: Italy, South Korea and Australia.
LaHood warned of the app’s dangers. “The national security threat that DeepSeek — a CCP-affiliated company — poses to the United States is alarming,” the Representative wrote in a press release. “DeepSeek’s generative AI program acquires the data of US users and stores the information for unidentified use by the CCP. Under no circumstances can we allow a CCP company to obtain sensitive government or personal data.”
“We must get to the bottom of DeepSeek’s malign activities,” Gottheimer wrote. “We simply can’t risk the CCP infiltrating the devices of our government officials and jeopardizing our national security.”This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/us-lawmakers-want-deepseek-banned-from-government-devices-212230100.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/ai/us-lawmakers-want-deepseek-banned-from-government-devices-212230100.html?src=rss,"Thu, 06 Feb 2025 21:22:30 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
Protecting the US from hackers apparently isn't in Trump's budget,"Members of the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are being forced to choose between staying at their jobs or taking a government buyout, NPR reports. The buyout program is one of several methods the current administration is deploying to shrink the federal government under the guidance of the ""Department of Governmental Efficiency"" (DOGE), an advisory group lead by Elon Musk.
CISA was creating during the first Trump Administration in 2018 to protect key infrastructure from cyber attacks and advise the government and its partners on building more secure infrastructure in the future. The agency played an important role in investigating Salt Typhoon in 2024, the hacking group that breached US telecom companies to get at government officials. Considering cybersecurity is becoming more critical, not less, short-staffing the agency could lead to problems.
The consequences of hollowing out or effectively eliminating key government agencies and departments don't seem to be a concern of DOGE or the Trump Administration, however. Along with CISA, staff at the IRS, CIA and Department of Education have also reportedly received the buyout ultimatum. The offer gives government employees until midnight on February 6 to accept a buyout and receive pay through October, or come back to work in-person, agree to new performance standards and promise to be ""reliable, loyal and trustworthy,"" according to USA Today.
The deal mirrors a similar offer Musk made to Twitter employees after he acquired the social media platform in 2022, even down to language describing it as a ""Fork in the Road."" A key difference between then and now is budget. The government hasn't set aside money to pay a bunch of employees to do nothing for eight months, and its not clear it plans to, because Congress ultimately controls government spending. Beyond that, a legal fight might make the whole thing moot. A US district judge in Boston has already ruled against the buyout deal, giving government employees until at least Monday to make a decision, Reuters writes, and there's the possibility of another extension still on the table.

Get one year of Peacock Premium for only $30,"Looking for a new streamer to fill the endless daily void? A year of Peacock Premium is on sale for just $30. Just use the code “WINTERSAVINGS” at checkout. This is a major discount of over 60 percent, as the typical price is $80. 
It’s important to note that, despite the name, this isn’t the actual premium tier. It includes ads, which could be a dealbreaker for some. However, there’s plenty to watch on this platform for those okay with the occasional long and harrowing commercial about random pharmaceuticals. Peacock, after all, easily made our list of the best streaming services. 

  
The platform is home to all kinds of original content, from Rian Johnson’s Poker Face to that surprisingly fun Twisted Metal adaptation. It’s also the only place to watch the dearly-departed AI-centric sci-fi romp Mrs. Davis.

The ESA wants to replace E3 with a bunch of buzzwords,"The Entertainment Software Association is making a fresh attempt to launch a gaming event. The new project is called iicon, or the ""interactive innovation conference."" It's not as catchy a name as E3, and sadly for the average gaming fan, it's probably not an event they'll care about as much as E3.
On the positive side, most of the big businesses in games that would have hosted sprawling booths at Los Angeles Convention Center back in the day have already signed on to this new endeavor. Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, Disney, EA, Epic Games, Ubisoft, Square Enix, Take Two Interactive, Amazon Games and Warner Bros. Games are all named as participants.
However, the announcements on social media promote iicon as being for ""visionaries,"" ""changemakers"" and ""innovators,"" so our best guess is that this event will swing more toward the corporate side of gaming where people might use that language unironically. If that's the case, this won't really be a replacement for the heyday of E3, when studios big and small would showcase their upcoming projects and drop internet-breaking surprises. Instead, the inaugural event in April 2026 sounds like it will focus more on moving the needle, brand alignments and synergy.
Since the old ESA event's decline and eventual demise in 2023, the consumer side of gaming is mostly being served by splashy events run by Geoff Keighley: the Summer Game Fest and the Game Awards. Both have already announced their 2025 dates.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-esa-wants-to-replace-e3-with-a-bunch-of-buzzwords-191544789.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-esa-wants-to-replace-e3-with-a-bunch-of-buzzwords-191544789.html?src=rss,"Thu, 06 Feb 2025 19:15:44 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
Prime Gaming's February freebies include BioShock Infinite and Wolfenstein: Youngblood,"Amazon has shared a list of video games that Prime members can snag for free this month, and there are some real gems. It’s a nice mix of AAA and indie titles. Additionally, the company revealed some new titles coming to the cloud-gaming platform Luna.

BioShock Infinite Complete Edition is available right now. This version includes the full game, as originally released back in 2013, plus all of the various DLC and add-ons that came after. We called it “an easy story to fall in love with” in our official review, and that certainly stands to this day.

The Talos Principle: Gold Edition is also ready to play right now. Just like Bioshock, this is the full game plus all of the DLC. We loved this story-driven puzzle title upon its release in 2015, calling it “mysterious and haunting, creative and beautiful.” It’s also super fun. Incidentally, there’s a remake coming sometime this year.
Other titles coming to Prime Gaming this month include Wolfenstein: Youngblood on February 20 and Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director&#39;s Cut on February 27. On the indie front, the co-op shooter AK-xolotl: Together is available right now and the pixelated roguelike western Colt Canyon drops on February 20.
Prime Gaming members in many parts of the world, including the US and much of Europe, also have access to the company’s cloud-gaming platform Luna. A bunch of new titles have hit the service this month, all of which are available to play right now.

These include Devil May Cry 5, Batora: Lost Haven, Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate Edition and Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition. Other freshly-dropped games include the fantastic action RPG Nobody Saves the World Complete and Batora: Lost Haven.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/prime-gamings-february-freebies-include-bioshock-infinite-and-wolfenstein-youngblood-182321261.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/prime-gamings-february-freebies-include-bioshock-infinite-and-wolfenstein-youngblood-182321261.html?src=rss,"Thu, 06 Feb 2025 18:23:21 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
OpenAI co-founder John Schulman has left Anthropic after less than a year,"Less than a year into his tenure at the company, OpenAI co-founder John Schulman is leaving Anthropic. The startup confirmed Schulman’s departure after The Information, Reuters and other publications reported on the exit.
""We are sad to see John go but fully support his decision to pursue new opportunities and wish him all the very best,” said Jared Kaplan, Anthropic's chief science officer, in a statement the company shared with Engadget. Schulman left OpenAI last August alongside Peter Deng, the company’s former vice-president of consumer product. Schulman is considered one of the original architects of ChatGPT.
Following his departure from OpenAI, Schulman said he was joining Anthropic to focus on AI alignment — the process of making machine learning models safe to use — and a desire to return “to more hands-on technical work.” Schulman hasn’t publicly said why he decided to leave Anthropic, nor what he plans to do next. His X profile still says he “recently joined” Anthropic.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-co-founder-john-schulman-has-left-anthropic-after-less-than-a-year-171124425.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-co-founder-john-schulman-has-left-anthropic-after-less-than-a-year-171124425.html?src=rss,"Thu, 06 Feb 2025 17:11:25 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
Google's Magic Editor will watermark its AI-tweaked photos,"Spotting AI&#39;s work can be increasingly difficult as its capabilities and subtleties continue to improve. This continued shift makes labeling AI generated work all the more critical — something that is being done in bits and pieces. The latest development to do so comes from Google, which will now use SynthID technology to mark mages edited using Reimagine in Magic Editor.&nbsp;
Google DeepMind launched SynthID in 2023, a technology that allows for imperceptible digital watermarks within any content created with generative AI. The company has previously used it in AI-powered programs such as Lyria, Imagen and Gemini.&nbsp;
Now, SynthID will be making its literal mark on Magic Editor. The tool allows users to reimagine their photos by moving, erasing or adding special effects to different aspects of the image. The Reimagine feature is available for anyone 18 or older and on the Pixel 9 or later. Users who click Reimagine can enter a prompt to change bits of the image. Google recommends entering specific, simple phrases, such as &quot;autumn leaves,&quot; and then explore potential options before picking one. The only difference is now that image will have a watermark from SynthID. It&#39;s available for anyone to see by clicking &quot;About this image.&quot;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-magic-editor-will-watermark-its-ai-tweaked-photos-170009281.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-magic-editor-will-watermark-its-ai-tweaked-photos-170009281.html?src=rss,"Thu, 06 Feb 2025 17:00:09 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater release date leaks on the PlayStation Store,"The release date for arguably one of the most anticipated games around has emerged, albeit in low-key fashion. According to an apparent leak on the PlayStation Store — perhaps about as official as you can get without a splashy announcement elsewhere — Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is set to arrive on August 28. It&#39;s scheduled to hit PC and Xbox Series X/S as well as PS5.
Sony had scrubbed the release date from the game&#39;s store page (which now only bears a release window of 2025) by the time of publication. A trailer for the remake of Hideo Kojima’s Metal Gear Solid 3 was hosted on Sony’s servers and also leaked. That featured the August 28 date too.
It’s not the first time that a game or its release date have come to light in exactly this way. We first received official word of The Last of Us Part 1, a remake of the first game in the series for PS5 and PC, in similar fashion a few years ago. The same thing happened with the remaster of the sequel.
It’s possible that Sony was preparing things behind the scenes ahead of a coordinated release date announcement for MGS Delta: Snake Eater. Given that a State of Play showcase is rumored to be taking place next week, it seems likely that the reveal was scheduled to take place then. But a release date that temporarily appeared on the PS Store — which was backed up by a trailer — is as clear an indicator as any that the remake will arrive this summer.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-leaks-on-the-playstation-store-153046876.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-leaks-on-the-playstation-store-153046876.html?src=rss,"Thu, 06 Feb 2025 15:30:46 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
Steam will label early access games that haven't been updated in a year,"When you click on an early access game on Steam, you might see a new note that could give an idea whether its developer has already abandoned the project. As SteamDB first reported, Steam has started adding notes on games&#39; official pages if they haven&#39;t been updated in a while.&nbsp;
Steam&#39;s early access program allows you to purchase work-in-progress titles to play on your PC. Each participating title has an information box, where developers answer questions, such as how long they expect the game to be in early access. That&#39;s where you can find the new warning, which tells you when a title was last updated. Not every game has a note that tells you when its last update was rolled out, though. Valve told PCGamer that it will only add the notice for an early access game if it hasn&#39;t been updated for a year.&nbsp;
Specifically, the note will show up if it&#39;s been 12 months since a new build has been added to the game&#39;s default branch in Steamworks, or if it&#39;s been 12 months since the developer has notified players about an &quot;update type event,&quot; which includes major updates, regular updates and patch notes. In the end, it&#39;s still up to you whether you want to download and play a game that hasn&#39;t had a recent update. But the warning could help you avoid projects that are pretty much dead if you don&#39;t want to waste your time and money on games that may never be fully released.&nbsp;

DeepSeek limits model access due to overwhelming server demand,"DeepSeek recent explosion in popularity continues to be a problem for the AI startup. In a notification spotted by Bloomberg, the company said it was temporarily limiting access to its application programming interface service in response to a shortage of server capacity.&nbsp;
&quot;Due to current server resource constraints, we have temporarily suspended API service recharges to prevent any potential impact on your operations,&quot; DeepSeek said. &quot;Existing balances can still be used for calls. We appreciate your understanding!&quot; Separately, DeepSeek announced pricing for its chat model would increase to $0.27 per million input tokens and $1.10 per million output tokens starting February 8.
DeepSeek has been dealing with overwhelming demand for its services since the debut of its R1 model on January 20. The company&#39;s emergence as a leading premier AI provider, and the fact it was able to train R1 for a fraction of the price it cost OpenAI to develop its o1 reasoning model, sent US investors into a panic. Major tech stocks, including NVIDIA, shed $1 trillion of value the Monday after DeepSeek&#39;s chatbot hit the top of the App Store.  Since then, OpenAI has released its o3-mini model and Deep Research feature for ChatGPT.&nbsp;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/deepseek-limits-model-access-due-to-overwhelming-server-demand-151339342.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/ai/deepseek-limits-model-access-due-to-overwhelming-server-demand-151339342.html?src=rss,"Thu, 06 Feb 2025 15:13:40 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
Capcom Fighting Collection 2 is a celebration of early 2000s brawlers,"Fighting games fans thought it would never happen. But then the first Capcom Fighting Game Collection came out last fall with remasters for some of the most important titles from the mid to late 90s (plus one from the 2000s) — all in the same package. We’re talking about absolute classics like X-Men: Children of the Atom, Marvel Super Heroes and most importantly, Marvel vs. Capcom 2. But the goodness doesn’t stop there because in a few months, another anthology is due out — the Capcom Fighting Collection 2 — which features an arguably even stronger lineup of brawlers from the early 2000s. And after getting the chance to preview the game prior to its official release on May 16, this assemblage is both a tribute to fighting game history and a great way to waste time smashing buttons.

Before we get in too deep, I should mention that only three out of the eight total titles were playable during my demo (Capcom vs SNK 2: Mark of the Millenium 2001, Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper and Project Justice). Regardless, here is the complete lineup of games in Capcom Fighting Collection 2:

Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 PRO
Capcom vs SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001
Capcom Fighting Evolution
Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper
Power Stone
Power Stone 2
Project Justice
Plasma Sword: Nightmare of Bilstein

The original marquee cards are just one of the many extras included for each game in the Capcom Fighting Collection 2. Capcom/SNK
Now I’ll be the first to admit that I don’t have a ton of experience with SFA3U or Project Justice compared to some of the other titles in this collection, but even with the latter featuring what looks like crude graphics by modern standards, it’s clear there’s an interesting fighting game beneath those big blocky polygons. Plus, thanks to a huge catalog of extras like classic instruction cards and move lists, it was easy to pick up the basics while getting additional context into the game’s development. I can’t wait to play more.
Meanwhile, Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper represents a version of the game that was hard to get outside of Japan and features a complete roster, including the six characters that were only available in certain home console releases. Notably, there’s also a fix for the glitch that allowed easy infinites when using the V-ISM mechanic, which is an oft-cited reason why the game didn’t catch on (especially in the West) as it upset balance and allowed people to abuse custom combos.
Capcom/SNK
But without a doubt, the crown jewel of the entire collection is Capcom vs SNK 2, which, in my opinion, is one of the top 10 fighting games of all time. From its funky character select screen with those iconic diamond tiles to an incredible soundtrack filled with bangers like the songs for the New York, Barentsburg and London stages, it’s got more style and personality than it knows what to do with. Seriously, put those tracks on and if you aren’t instantly bobbing your head to the beat, you might be dead inside.
CvS2 also offers more polished takes on the ratio system from its predecessor and the ISMs from SFA3 with the Groove system that gives you a wealth of playstyles for every character. So even though I only had 30 minutes to play, I couldn’t help but grin every time I got to unleash a custom combo using A-Groove Ken or troll the CPU with ratio four Haohmaru. The controls are tight, the graphics are super crisp and the game plays just as well as I remember. Better, even, considering today’s controllers and arcade sticks are more precise than anything we had 20+ years ago.
Capcom/SNK
While I didn’t have a chance to test it, it’s also important to note that the collection is adding online multiplayer with rollback netcode to every game. This should be a huge upgrade when compared to alternative solutions such as apps like Fightcade, which often aren’t as stutter-free as proper in-game matchmaking (as evidenced by some of the hiccups in the clip above). My one small complaint is that while I appreciate little details like having a bunch of visual treatments that make the game look better when played on modern LCDs compared to old-school CRTs, I wish they came with more descriptive labels instead of simply being listed as Filter A, B, C, etc.
Capcom/SNK
But perhaps most importantly, by putting all these games in one place, it’s so much easier for people to access titles like CvS2, which have been hard to find since its original release back in 2001. Honestly, I’d pay $40 just to have a modern version of CvS2 and Power Stone 2 that I can play without dusting off a PS2 or Dreamcast (the latter of which I don’t even own). So to get both of those alongside six other titles with tons of original art, improved training modes, a couple of bonus songs and a limited edition comic book (only for physical copies, though) feels like a truly excellent value. Sure, these games might just be rereleases, but for those with fond memories of early 2000s fighting games, it feels like this is true love we’re makin’ all over again.
The Capcom Fighting Collection 2 is available for pre-order now with official sales starting on May 16 for $40.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/capcom-fighting-collection-2-is-a-celebration-of-early-2000s-brawlers-150055451.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/gaming/capcom-fighting-collection-2-is-a-celebration-of-early-2000s-brawlers-150055451.html?src=rss,"Thu, 06 Feb 2025 15:00:55 +0000",Sports,www.engadget.com
A four-pack of Apple AirTags is on sale for $70,"If you're constantly losing your stuff, Bluetooth trackers can help. Now's a good time to invest in some AirTags if you're an iPhone user, because you can get a four-pack of the trackers for only $70. This is a record-low price for the bundle, and represents a 29 percent discount. It also breaks down to around $17.50 per AirTag. 
Apple AirTags easily made our list of the best Bluetooth trackers, and this is especially true if you use an iPhone. The finding network is comprehensive and works just about anywhere. Just imagine all of those other Apple devices out there in the world helping to create this network. The end result? You’ll likely find what you’re looking for. 

  
These trackers can also use the ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless protocol, which gamifies finding lost objects. As long as the object is within 25 feet of your smartphone, the screen will display directional arrows and a distance meter. You use this data to zero in on the object, all without constantly ringing the AirTag. 
Of course, AirTags aren’t perfect. They are designed to work with iPhones and other Apple products, so Android users should keep scrolling. Also, the ringer only pings for seven seconds at a time. Sometimes that’s enough to find a lost item, but not always.&nbsp; 
Finally, Apple decided to not include attachment points with these trackers, so they can’t connect to a keychain or a related accessory. However, there are plenty of amazing accessories for AirTags that get the job done.

"Volkswagen is unveiling a $21,000 entry-level EV in March","Volkswagen is working on an entry-level electric vehicle that will sell for a base price of €20,000 ($21,000). The company has already given its own employees a look at its initial design during a meeting in Wolfsburg, Germany, where it announced the new model. Volkswagen plans to unveil the model to the public in early March, though its production version won&#39;t be ready until sometime in 2027.&nbsp;
The automaker has yet to reveal the upcoming model&#39;s details or specs, but it will be part of an upcoming lineup of small electric cars that includes the ID.2all. Volkswagen, which first revealed the ID.2all concept in 2023, said its production version is scheduled to reach dealerships in 2026. While the €20,000 model is slated to become Volkswagen&#39;s most affordable EV, the ID.2all will be the brand&#39;s first small all-electric car. It will have a base price of €25,000 when it becomes available. It&#39;s not quite clear if the upcoming entry-level model will be released around the world, though, since Volkswagen&#39;s Thomas Schäfer called it an &quot;affordable, high-quality, and profitable electric Volkswagen from Europe for Europe.&quot;
Volkswagen has sold more than 1.35 million ID vehicles around the world since it launched the ID product family in 2019. That number includes the 500,000 ID.3 it sold last year. One of the company&#39;s latest releases is the long-awaited ID.Buzz, an electric van with a retro aesthetic that currently has a starting price of $59,995 in the US.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/volkswagen-is-unveiling-a-21000-entry-level-ev-in-march-150057140.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/volkswagen-is-unveiling-a-21000-entry-level-ev-in-march-150057140.html?src=rss,"Thu, 06 Feb 2025 14:15:57 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
Leica’s LUX grip is a pricey way to add camera controls to your iPhone,"Leica is mainly known for its high-end cameras, but it also makes smartphone camera lenses. Today, the company is announcing its new LUX grip for iPhone, designed to mimic the feel of a Leica camera. It weighs 120 grams and is designed for ambidextrous use.
The Leica LUX grip has a two-stage shutter for precise shots. There’s a button to change between shooting modes and another to choose from frequently-used functions that you can select using the Leica LUX app. A control dial is also there  to make it easier to switch between settings like zoom, aperture and shutter speed. After 1,000 shots, the Leica LUX grip’s battery must be recharged via USB-C for two hours.
As mentioned, the app works with the grip, which communicates with the iPhone via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). In addition to customizing the button, the app includes bokeh effects from the Summilux-M and Noctilux-M lenses, Leica Looks (preset effects that don’t require post-processing) and more.
The Leica LUX grip is now available for £260/€300, including VAT. An additional case is available for £50. Each grip purchase includes a yearlong premium Leica LUX app subscription.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/leicas-lux-grip-is-a-pricey-way-to-add-camera-controls-to-your-iphone-140031130.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/cameras/leicas-lux-grip-is-a-pricey-way-to-add-camera-controls-to-your-iphone-140031130.html?src=rss,"Thu, 06 Feb 2025 14:00:31 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
Lyft uses Anthropic's Claude chatbot to handle customer complaints,"Lyft is partnering with Anthropic to bring the startup&#39;s AI tech to its platform. &quot;Anthropic, known for its human-centric approach to AI, will work with Lyft to build smart, safe, and empathetic AI-powered products that put riders and drivers first,&quot; the two said in a joint press release.
If you&#39;re a frequent Lyft rider, you can see the early results of that collaboration when you go through the company&#39;s customer care AI assistant, which features integration with Anthrophic&#39;s Claude chatbot. According to Lyft, the tool is already helping to resolve thousands of driver issues every day, and has reduced average resolution times by 87 percent. The company plans to make it available to riders soon.&nbsp;
Moving forward, Lyft plans to integrate Anthropic&#39;s tech across its business. As part of the partnership, Lyft will get early access to the startup’s products and models, and will in turn assist Anthropic with testing those capabilities. Lyft says this will allow it to integrate Anthropic&#39;s AI models in a way that aligns with the needs of its drivers and customers. Last but not least, Anthropic will provide training and education to Lyft’s software engineers.
&quot;Lyft is using Claude to both reimagine the future of ridesharing, and at the same time deliver tangible benefits to their community today,&quot; said Michael Gerstenhaber, vice president of product management at Anthropic. &quot;This approach, combined with their deep collaboration with our team of experts, creates a blueprint for how companies can successfully bring AI into their business.&quot;
Lyft is no stranger to working with other companies, particularly when it involves AI technology. At the end of last year, it partnered with three companies in the autonomous vehicle space — Mobileye, May Mobility and Nexar. Lyft plans to start introducing their technologies into its network starting this year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/lyft-uses-anthropics-claude-chatbot-to-handle-user-complaints-140026067.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/ai/lyft-uses-anthropics-claude-chatbot-to-handle-user-complaints-140026067.html?src=rss,"Thu, 06 Feb 2025 14:00:26 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
"Workday lays off 1,750 employees, citing demand for AI","Workday, the HR and finance management company, is the latest tech giant to lay off a mass of employees in the name of AI. In a Wednesday announcement titled &quot;Changes to Position Workday for the Future,&quot; the organization shared that it&#39;s eliminating 1,750 employees, about 8.5 percent of its workforce. The public statement from CEO Carl Eschenbach was initially emailed to employees.&nbsp;
Within a series of paragraphs in which Eschenbach acted really torn up about choosing AI over people, he summed up this trend pretty clearly: &quot;Companies everywhere are reimagining how work gets done, and the increasing demand for AI has the potential to drive a new era of growth for Workday.&quot;
Eschenbach later adds that Workday will be &quot;prioritizing innovation investments like AI and platform development, and rigorously evaluating the ROI of others across the board.&quot; Though, he claims the company will also &quot;hire in key strategic areas and locations&quot; this year.
According to the announcement, Workday tried to meet with as many impacted employees as possible on Wednesday, so some individuals might not immediately know their fate. US-based employees will receive at least 12 weeks of pay, while employees in other countries (with potentially stronger protections for workers) will receive benefits based on local regulations.&nbsp;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/workday-lays-off-1750-employees-citing-demand-for-ai-134922398.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/ai/workday-lays-off-1750-employees-citing-demand-for-ai-134922398.html?src=rss,"Thu, 06 Feb 2025 13:49:23 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
Anker's latest charger and power bank are back on sale for record-low prices,"Anker made a number of announcements at CES 2025, including new chargers and power banks. We saw a couple of them get early discounts immediately after the show, and now those sales are back. The Anker Charger (140W, 4-Port, PD 3.1) is $10 off again and down to $80 on Amazon, and the 100W Laptop Power Bank has the same discount and is down to $90. 
The Anker Charger has three USB-C ports and one USB-A port. Two USB-C ports can charge a 15-inch MacBook Air to 50 percent within 30 minutes. The built-in display also shows temperature, port-specific wattage and current maximum output. At less than 10 ounces, it’s a brick you can take anywhere. 

  
As for the laptop power bank, it has a maximum single output of 100W and charges up to four devices at once thanks to its 25,000 mAh capacity. The retractable cables prevent the possibility of a tangled mess of wires. While capable of charging a MacBook Pro to 50 percent in 33 minutes, this power bank can be recharged to 30 percent in 20 minutes, allowing for frequent use. 
While those are the main Anker devices from CES on sale at the moment, the company has a slew of other discounts available. The Anker 621 5K magnetic power bank has dropped to $30, while the Anker Zolo 10K portable charger is 40 percent off and down to $16, just to name a few.

"The best streaming deals: Save on Disney+, Sling TV, DirecTV and more","Whether you’re a true cord-cutter or you just want to watch the next season of Stranger Things when it (eventually? maybe?) drops, everyone’s on the lookout for streaming deals nowadays. Plenty have chosen VOD and live TV streaming services over traditional cable in recent years, but the savings that choice got you just a few years ago have somewhat evaporated now. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore. 
We at Engadget still think so, for many reasons, but you can (and should) be smart with your money at the same time. Streaming deals are an option, even if they don’t come around with the same regularity as discounts on AirPods do. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. 
Best streaming deals 
True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. 
If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now. 

  
DirecTV MySports beta for $50/month for three months ($20/month off): DirecTV’s recently announced MySports beta package is $50 per month for the first three months if you sign up before the end of February. That means you’ll save a total of $60 for that timeframe. In addition to sports channels like FS1, ESPN and NFL Network, the package includes more than 25 live and local TV channels and unlimited DVR recordings. 
Sling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total. 
Fubo Essential for $60/month for the first month ($25 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, but Essential may be the best for most people. It offers access to 215 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. Note that regional sports content is not included here; you’ll have to go up to Pro or Elite plans for that. 
YouTube TV for $70/month for the first six months ($78 off): New subscribers can save a total of $78 when they sign up for YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. 
Spotify student discount - Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. 
Hulu student discount - subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. 
Max student discount - subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. 
Streaming bundle discounts 
There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. 
Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now. 

  
Disney+ and Hulu Duo Premium for $20/month: This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually. 
Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Trio Basic for $17/month: You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 47 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions. 
Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Trio Premium for $27/month: Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately. 
Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle with ads for $17/month: Max may not technically be under the Disney mega-umbrella, but you get full, ad-supported access to its content here along with Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually. 
Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle no ads for $30/month: The major difference between this bundle and the previous is the lack of ads across most content in all three services. Download support for offline watching is included, too. Compared to the $52/month you’d pay for these tiers separately, you’ll save 42 percent with this combination. 
Hulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads. 
Paramount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year: This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features.

OM System's OM-3 camera marries vintage style with a high-tech stacked sensor,"OM System has unveiled the OM-3 Micro Four Thirds mirrorless camera, combining an old-school Olympus-style body with the latest stacked sensor technology. The new model offers buyers many of the capabilities of the company's flagship $2,300 OM-1 Mark II, including fast shooting speeds and 4K 60p video, at a slightly lower price point.&nbsp; 
The OM-3 is a brand new product line for OM System, falling between the OM-1 II and OM-5. It's quite a bit prettier than either model, though, evoking the older, coveted Olympus PEN-F camera. Like that model, it lacks a raised grip — so users must rely on the leatherette texture and thumb rest to keep hold of it. For travelers, the OM-3 is relatively light at just 17.5 ounces (496 grams) without a lens, a bit less than Fujifilm's X100 VI.&nbsp; 

 
 
 
  OM System
 
 
The body is replete with dials and switches, including a pair of shooting dials, a mode dial and another to change between shooting photos, video and S&amp;Q. One unusual feature is a ""creative dial"" at the front (borrowed from the Pen-F) that lets you switch between five modes (standard, mono, color, art and color creator). Those open up screen menus that allow further customization.&nbsp; 
Inside, though, the OM-3 is effectively a mini OM-1 II. Like that model, it comes with a 20.37-megapixel stacked BSI sensor that delivers very fast 50fps shooting speeds with continuous autofocus. It also offers the same 1,053-point on-chip phase-detect autofocus system along with pre-capture shooting of up to 70 frames. And despite the small size, it comes with five-axis in-body stabilization, albeit with lower performance (6.5 stops instead of 8) compared to the OM-1 II.&nbsp; 

 
 
 
  OM System
 
 
The other major downgrade is the lower-resolution 2.36-million-dot EVF that's a bit disappointing given the price (the OM-1 II has a nice 5.76-million-dot EVF). It also comes with just a single UHS-II memory card slot. However, the OM-3 has the same 3.0-inch vari-angle display as the OM-1 II, which is nice for content creators, while also offering identical IP53 weather sealing and the same BLX-1 battery with 590 shots max in standard mode. 
On the video side, the OM-3 can shoot 4K video at up to 60p using the full sensor width with 10-bit log recording (though it can't shoot 10-bit video in standard mode like Panasonic's latest cameras). It also offers 1080p slow-mo at up to 240fps, albeit with a crop. If you're willing to use an external recorder, it can capture 4K RAW video at up to 60fps. Like the OM-1 II, the OM-3 has minimal rolling shutter in all video modes, so it should be great for capturing action.&nbsp; 

 
 
The OM-3 is now on pre-order for $2,000 (body only), or $2,300 in a kit with the M.Zuiko Digital ED 12-45mm f/4 Pro lens. Shipping is expected to begin in late February. Olympus also announced an updated, more rugged version of its 100-400mm zoom, the $1,500 M.Zuiko Digital ED 100-400mm F5.0-6.3 IS II, along with new weather resistant primes, the M.Zuiko Digital 17mm F2.8 II ($550) and M.Zuiko Digital 25mm F1.8 II ($500).&nbsp;

The best robot vacuum for 2025,"Looking to keep your home clean without having to vacuum and mop every day, pick up dirt, the dinner your child threw on the floor or your furry friend’s endless pet hair? Join the club. Smart home gadgets have come a long way over the years, and that includes robot vacuums. With newer technology including voice controls, object detection and more automation features, investing in a robot vacuum cleaner makes more sense now than ever before. Some of the best robot vacuum cleaners even have mopping capabilities, roller brush options and self-emptying bases, too, and there are plenty that don't cost a fortune either. If you’re ready to adopt a less hands-on approach and let a robot vacuum cleaner do the hard work for you, consider our recommendations below.

What to look for in a robot vacuum 
Wi-Fi connectivity 
As we explained in our budget guide, Wi-Fi connectivity is a key feature for most robot vacuums. Some of the affordable devices aren’t Wi-Fi connected, though, so it’s best to double check before you buy cheap. Wi-Fi lets a robot vacuum cleaner do things like communicate with a mobile app, which then allows you to control the device from your phone. 
Vacuum suction 
Suction power is another important factor to consider. Unfortunately, there isn’t a standard power scale that all robo-vacs adhere to, so it’s difficult to compare among a bunch of devices. Some companies provide Pascal (Pa) levels and generally the higher the Pa, the stronger the vacuum cleaner will be. But other companies don’t rely on Pa and simply say their robots have X-times more suction than other robots. 
Floor type 
Ultimately, we recommend thinking first about the floors in your home: Do you have carpet throughout, or tile and hardwood floors, or a mix? Robots with stronger suction power will do a better job cleaning carpets as they can get into the nooks and crannies more easily. Some machines have “max” modes as well, which ups the suction power but also typically eats at battery life faster than the “normal” cleaning mode. 
Mapping features and object detection 
Past a certain price threshold, you’ll find advanced perks like home mapping features, improved object detection and automatic dustbin disposal. Home mapping is exactly what it sounds like: The vacuum uses sensors to map your home’s layout as it cleans, allowing you to send it to particular rooms or areas. Most robo-vacs have object detection, but some will be better than others at actually avoiding things like chair legs and children’s toys. Higher-end models like iRobot’s j7 series even go so far as to promise obstacle avoidance to steer clear of things like pet poop that can potentially ruin your machine. 
Robot vacuums with mopping capabilities 
We’re also now starting to see more robot vacuums with mopping capabilities. Machines with this feature have a water tank either built into the robot’s chassis or as a separate piece that you swap in for the dustbin when you want to mop your floors. It makes the robo-vac more useful if you have hard floors in your home that you like to keep squeaky clean, but it does require more work on your part. Filling and emptying the reservoir remains a human’s job for the most part (except on the most expensive machines), as does adding cleaning solutions if the mopping robot comes with this feature to ensure it uses clean water for every cycle. 
Auto-empty station 
Finally, for peak convenience, consider a robot vacuum that comes with a self-emptying base station. These are basically garbage bins attached to the machine’s docking station. At the end of each job, the robo-vac automatically empties its small dustbin into the large clean base – that means you won’t have to empty the dustbin yourself and you’ll only have to tend to the base once every few weeks. Just keep in mind that most self-emptying bins require proprietary garbage bags – another long-term expense you’ll have to factor in. Also, any vac-and-mop robot with a water tank will not dump its dirty water into the clean base, so you’ll still have to clean up that yourself. 
Robot vacuum maintenance tips 
First and foremost, always empty your robot vacuum’s dustbin after every cleaning job. If you have a model with a self-emptying base, there’s less work for you to do yourself. If not, simply detach and empty the dustbin as soon as the robot is done cleaning. It’s also a good idea to take a dry cloth to the inside of the dustbin every once in a while to remove any small dust and dirt particles clinging to its insides. 
In addition, you’ll want to regularly examine the machine’s brushes to see if any hair has wrapped around them, or if any large debris is preventing them from working properly. Some brushes are better than others at not succumbing to tangled hair, but it’s a good idea to check your robot’s brushes regardless — both their main brush and any smaller roller brushes or corner brushes they have. These parts are often easy to pop off of the machine (because they do require replacements eventually) so we recommend removing each brush entirely, getting rid of any tangled hair or other debris attached to them and reinstalling them afterwards. 
Robot vacuums also have filters that need replacing every couple of months. Check your machine’s user manual or the manufacturer’s website to see how long they recommend going in between filter replacements. Most of the time, these filters cannot be washed, so you will need to buy new ones either directly from the manufacturer or from other retailers like Amazon or Walmart. 
Robot vacuum FAQs 
Are robot vacuums worth it? 
We tackled this question when we reviewed budget robot vacuums and the answer is yes, especially if vacuuming is one of your least favorite chores. Robots take the hard work out of cleaning your floors – just turn the thing on and watch it go. Any robot vacuum cleaner worth buying is semi-autonomous in that it will suck up dirt around your home until its battery is low and then make its way back to its charging dock. Unlike a regular vacuum, you should only have to interact with it to turn it on, empty its dustbin and untangle it if it were to get stuck somewhere. 
That’s not to say robot vacuums are perfect. They’re almost always less powerful and less flexible than traditional vacuums. Since most robo-vacs are much smaller than traditional models, they often don’t have the same level of suction you’ll get in an upright machine. Plus, their dustbins are smaller, so they will need to be emptied more frequently. While Wi-Fi-connected robot vacuums give you the flexibility to start a cleaning job from anywhere using an app, targeting a small area of your home can be more complicated. Some robo-vacs have spot-cleaning features that focus the machine’s attention on a specific area, which almost – but not quite – mimics the spot-cleaning you’d be able to do yourself with a regular or cordless vacuum. 
How long do robot vacuums last? 
Robot vacuums can last many years, if you take care of them properly. Check out our recommendations for robot vacuum maintenance above, but in a nutshell, you should make sure that you're emptying the machine's bin after every job and periodically cleaning the interior of the bin and the brushes. It's also a good idea to check the user manual to see how often your robot vacuum's filter needs changing. 
Do robot vacuums work better than handheld vacuums? 
There's no straight answer to this question. Robot vacuums offer more convenience than handheld vacuums, so for those who are looking to automate a chore, that could mean one of these devices works better for them than a standard vacuum. However, handheld vacuum cleaners often have stronger suction power, and they give the user a bit more control. It ultimately depends on how you intend to use your main vacuum cleaner and what you want to prioritize most. 
How often do you have to clean a robot vacuum? 
Cleaning a robot vacuum isn’t too much of a chore, but you’ll want to give it a little TLC every few weeks or so, depending on how often you’re running it and how much dirt it’s picking up. The dustbin usually needs to be emptied after each cleaning run, especially if you have pets or lots of carpet where dirt can hide. Many newer models have self-emptying docks, which means you won’t have to empty the dustbin yourself after every use, but the main bin will still need a good clean once a month or so. Also, it’s a good idea to check the side brushes and main brush for any hair tangles or debris every couple of weeks to keep things running smoothly. 
What are the negatives of robot vacuums? 
Robot vacuums won’t work for everyone. One of the biggest drawbacks is that they usually don’t have the same suction power as a full-sized upright vacuum or even a cordless stick vacuum, so they might struggle with deep-cleaning thick carpets. They’re also designed for floors only, so if you’re looking to clean furniture, stairs or other tricky spots, you’ll still need a traditional vacuum to do that. Plus, they can sometimes get stuck or miss spots, especially if you’ve got a lot of furniture or obstacles in the way. While their sensors help, they might still bump into things or need a little help getting out of tight spots. And while most have decent dirt detection features, they’re best for keeping things tidy rather than doing heavy-duty cleaning.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html?src=rss,"Thu, 06 Feb 2025 10:00:37 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
ASUS’s Zenfone 12 Ultra leans heavily into AI,"The Zenfone 12 Ultra, announced today, is ASUS&#39;s latest flagship smartphone, and much like its competitors, it leans hard into AI.
Thanks to a Snapdragon 8 Elite, the Zenfone 12 Ultra can perform AI tasks offline and online through the cloud, including transcribing audio, summarizing articles and documents and providing real-time interpretation on calls for supported languages. It can also use Circle to Search much like other Android phones. The onboard AI is powered by Meta’s Llama 3 8B language model, which works without an internet connection.
The Zenfone 12 Ultra’s FHD+ AMOLED display measures 6.78 inches and has a standard refresh rate of up to 120Hz under normal operation, and up to 144Hz while gaming. A rear tri-camera system handles photo and video and consists of a 50-megapixel Sony Lytia 700 sensor with a six-axis gimbal stabilizer, a 32MP telephoto lens and a 12MP ultrawide lens with a field of view of 120 degrees. There’s also a 32MP RGBW front camera for selfies. AI software enhancements can ensure people or pets stay at the center of videos, and can apply bokeh effects to portraits and enhance voice clarity while recording videos.
A standout with this new Zenfone is its 5,500mAh battery, which promises more than 26 hours of use. It&#39;s also Qi 1.3 compatible. Additionally, the smartphone supports eSIMs, making connecting to the internet effortless. WiFi 7 support will let users take advantage of high-speed networks if available.
The Zenfone 12 Ultra retails for €1,099.99, and there&#39;s a limited-time launch offer of €999.99 in Europe from February 6 to 28. It comes in three colorways: Sage Green, Ebony Black and Sakura White. US and UK launch dates haven’t been announced yet.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/asuss-zenfone-12-ultra-leans-heavily-into-ai-063040420.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/asuss-zenfone-12-ultra-leans-heavily-into-ai-063040420.html?src=rss,"Thu, 06 Feb 2025 06:30:40 +0000",Technology,www.engadget.com
Sonos will cut 'about 200' jobs in restructuring,"Sonos is embarking on a restructuring plan that will eliminate about 200 positions at the company. Interim CEO Tom Conrad announced the news in a call with the team, then shared the news in a public statement.
Conrad said the company is ""reorganizing our Product organization into functional groups for Hardware, Software, Design, Quality and Operations, and away from dedicated business units devoted to individual product categories. With this simpler organization in place, cross-functional project teams will come together to improve our core experience and deliver new products.""
Sonos has been taking a beating financially and in the public eye after the launching a poorly received app redesign last year. The company already laid off 100 employees in August. Since then, CEO Patrick Spence and Chief Product Officer Maxime Bouvat-Merlin have also departed, and the company has altered some of its product release plans. Yesterday, rumors circulated that a new streaming box could be coming from Sonos in the coming months.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/sonos-will-cut-about-200-jobs-in-restructuring-233809885.html?src=rss",https://www.engadget.com/audio/sonos-will-cut-about-200-jobs-in-restructuring-233809885.html?src=rss,"Wed, 05 Feb 2025 23:38:09 +0000",Daily News,www.engadget.com
